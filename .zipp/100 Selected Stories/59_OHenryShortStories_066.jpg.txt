A Ramble in Aphasia
MY WIFE AND I PARTED on that morning in precisely our usual
manner. She left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front
door. There she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint
(the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership) and bade me
take care of my cold. I had no cold. Next came her kiss of parting
- the level kiss of domesticity flavoured with Young Hyson. There
was no fear of the extemporaneous, of variety spicing her infinite
custom. With the deft touch of long malpractice, she dabbed awry
my well-set scarf-pin; and then, as I closed the door, I heard her
morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea.
