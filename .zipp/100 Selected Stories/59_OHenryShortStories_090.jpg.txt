At the hotel that night the main topic of conversation, with the
possible exceptions of polities and prohibition, was the demise off
Major Caswell. I heard one man say to a group of listeners:
‘In my opinion, gentlemen, Caswell was murdered by some of
these no-account niggers for his money. He had fifty dollars this
afternoon which he showed to several gentlemen in the hotel.
When he was found the money was not on his person.’
I left the city the next morning at nine, and as the train was
crossing the bridge over the Cumberland River I took oat of my
pocket a yellow, horn, overcoat button the size of a fifty-cent
piece, with frayed ends of coarse twine hanging from it, and cast it
out of the window into the slow, muddy waters below.
I wonder what’r doing in Baffalo!
