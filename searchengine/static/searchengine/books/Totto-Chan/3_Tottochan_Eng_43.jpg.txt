&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk to him,&rdquo; said Totto-chan to Miyo-chan and Sakko-chan. They went over to
 Takahashi. As they approached him he smiled affably, and they smiled back. He had
 big round eyes and looked as if he wanted to say something.
 &ldquo;wWould you like to see the classroom in the train?&rdquo; Totto-chan offered.
 &ldquo;Mm!&rdquo; replied Takahashi, putting his hat back on his head.
 Totto-chan was in a great hurry to show him the classroom and bounded over to the
 train, calling to him from the door, &ldquo;Hurry up.&rdquo;
 Takahashi seemed to be walking fast but was still a long way off.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; he said as he toddled along trying to run.
 Totto-chan realized that while Takahashi didn&rsquo;t drag his leg like Yasuaki-chan, who
 had had polio, he was taking the same amount of time to get to the train. She quietly
 waited for him. Takahashi was running as fast as he could and there was no need to
 say, &ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; for he was hurrying. His legs were very short and he was bow-legged.
 The teachers and grown-ups knew that he had stopped growing. When he saw that
 Totto-chan was watching him, he tried to hurry faster, swinging his arms, and when
 he got to the door, he said, &ldquo;You do run fast.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Osaka.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Osaka!&rdquo; cried Totto-chan excitedly. Osaka was a dream city she had never seen.
 Mother&rsquo;s younger brother&mdash;her uncle--was a university student, and whenever he
 came to the house he used to take her head in both his hands and lift her up as high as
 he could, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you Osaka. Can you see Osaka?&rdquo;
 It was just a game grown-ups used to play with children, but Totto-chan believed
 him. It stretched the skin of her face horribly and pulled her eyes our of shape and
 hurt her ears, but she would frantically look into the distance to try and see Osaka.
 But she never could. She always believed, however, that one day she would be able
 to see it, so whenever her uncle came, she would ask, &ldquo;Show me Osaka.&rdquo; So Osaka
 had become the city of her dreams. And Takahashi came from there!
 &ldquo;Tell me about Osaka,&rdquo; she said to Takahashi.
 &ldquo;About Osaka?&rdquo; he asked, smiling happily. His voice was dear and mature. Just then
 the bell rang for the first class.
 &ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; said Totto-chan. Takahashi went in gaily, swinging the little body that
 was almost hidden by his bag, and sat down in the front row. Totto-chan hurriedly sat
 down next to him. She was glad you could sit anywhere you liked. She didn&rsquo;t want to
 leave him. Thus, Takahashi became one of her friends, too.
 &lsquo;&lsquo;Look before You Leap!&rsquo;&rsquo;
 On the way home from school, just as she had almost reached home, Totto-chan
 discovered something enticing by the side of the road. It was a huge pile of sand.
 How extraordinary to find sand there, so far from the sea! Was she dreaming! Totto-
 chan was thrilled. After a preliminary little hop she ran at great speed toward the pile
 of sand and leaped onto its summit. But it wasn&rsquo;t sand after all! Inside, it was a heap
