Mother could never understand how Totto-chan&rsquo;s lace-trimmed panties got ton every
 day around the rear. She could see how panties could get muddy and worn thin by
 going down slides or falling on one&rsquo;s bottom, but how did they get torn to shreds?
 Totto-chan thought about it for a while, then said, &ldquo;You see, when you burrow under
 a fence you can&rsquo;t help catching your skirt as you go through, and your panties when
 you back out, and you have to do an &rsquo;Excuse me, may I come in!&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Well,
 goodbye then from one end of the fence to the other, so your panties and things are
 bound to tear.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Mother didn&rsquo;t really understand, but it sounded rather amusing.
 &ldquo;Is it fun?&rdquo; she asked.
 &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try it?&rdquo; said Totto-chan, astonished at the question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great fun and
 you&rsquo;ll tear your panties, too!&rdquo;
 The game that Totto-chan liked so much and found so thrilling went like this.
 First you had to find a large vacant lot surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. &ldquo;Excuse
 me, may I come in?&rdquo; consisted of lifting up the spiked wire, digging a hole, and
 crawling under. Once inside you lifted up a neighboring bit of barbed wire and dug
 another hole, this time backing out saying, &ldquo;Well, goodbye then.&rdquo; It became quite
 clear to Mother how Totto-chan&rsquo;s skirt got drawn up as she backed out causing her
 panties to catch on the barbed wire. The process would be repeated over and over
 again&mdash;burrowing under the wire with an &ldquo;Excuse me, may I come in?&rdquo; and then
 backing our through a fresh hole with a &ldquo;Well, goodbye then,&rdquo; tearing skirt and
 panties every time. Totto-chan happily zigzagged back and forth burrowing under the
 barbed-wire fence from one end to the other. No wonder her panties got torn.
 To think that a game like that, which would only tire a grown-up and not be amusing
 at all, could be such fun to a child! Watching Totto-chan, with dirt in her hair and
 fingernails and even in her ears, Mother couldn&rsquo;t help feeling a little envious. And
 she couldn&rsquo;t help admiring the headmaster. His suggestion that the children wear
 clothes they could get as dirty as they liked was just another example of how well he
 understood them.
 Takahaski
 One morning, when they were all running about the school grounds, the headmaster
 said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a new friend for you. His last name is Takahashi. He&rsquo;ll be joining the
 first grade train.&rdquo;
 The children, including Totto-chan, looked at Takahashi. He took off his hat and
 bowed, and said shyly, &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
 Totto-chan and her classmates were still quite small, being only in the first grade, but
 Takahashi, although he was a boy, was much smaller still, with short arms and legs.
 His hands, in which he held his hat, were small, too. But he had broad shoulders. He
 stood there looking forlorn.
