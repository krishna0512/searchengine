Takahashi was so small he crawled under his desk to get to the center of the circle
 and was there as quick as a wink. He said in a cheerful voice, &ldquo;Thank you Ryo-chan.
 Thank you forever thing. For all sorts of things.&rdquo;
 Aiko Saisho stood up next. She said, &ldquo;Ryo-chan, thank you for bandaging me up that
 time I fell down. I&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo; Aiko Saisho&rsquo;s great-uncle was the famous
 Admiral Togo of the Russo-Japanes War, and Atsuko Saisho, another relative of
 hers, was a celebrated poetess at Emperor Meiji&rsquo;s court. But Aiko never mentioned
 them.
Miyo-chan, the headmaster&rsquo;s daughter, knew Ryo-chan the best. Her eyes were full
 of tears. &ldquo;Take care of yourself, won&rsquo;t you, Ryo-chan. Let&rsquo;s write to each other.
 Totto-chan had so many things she wanted to say she didn&rsquo;t know where to begin. So
 she just said, &ldquo;Even though you&rsquo;re gone, Ryo-chan, we&rsquo;ll have a tea party every day.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The headmaster laughed, and so did Ryo-chan. All the children laughed, too, even
 Totto-chan herself.
 But Totto-chan&rsquo;s words came true the very next day. Whenever there was time the
 children would form a group and play &ldquo;tea party.&rdquo; Instead of dried squid, they would
 suck things like tree bark, and they sipped glasses of water instead of tea, sometimes
 pretending it was sake. Someone would say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you some funeral
 dumplings,&rdquo; and they&rsquo;d all laugh. Then they&rsquo;d talk and tell each other their thoughts.
 Even though there wasn&rsquo;t anything to eat, the &ldquo;tea parties&rdquo; were fun.
 The &ldquo;tea party&rdquo; was a wonderful farewell gift that Ryo-chan left the children. And
 although none of them had the faintest idea then, it was in fact the last game they
 were to play at Tomoe before the children parted and went their separate ways.
 Ryo-chan went off on the Toyoko train. His departure coincided with the arrival of
 the American airplanes. They finally appeared in the skies above Tokyo and began
 dropping bombs every day.
 Sayonara, Sayonara!
 Tomoe burned down. It happened at night. Miyo-chan, her sister Misa-chan, and
 their mother&mdash;who all lived in the house adjoining the school--fled to the Tomoe
 farm by the pond at Kuhonbutsu Temple and were safe.
 Lots of incendiary bombs dropped by the 829 bombers fell on the railroad cars that
 served as schoolrooms.
 The school that had been the headmaster&rsquo;s dream was enveloped in flames. Instead of
 the sounds he loved so much of children laughing and children singing, the school
 was collapsing with a fearful noise. The fire, impossible to quench, burned it down to
 the ground. Fires blared up all over Jiyugaoka.
 In the midst of it all, the headmaster stood in the road and watched Tomoe burn. He
 was dressed, as usual, in his rather shabby black three-piece suit. He stood with both
 hands in his jacket pockets.
