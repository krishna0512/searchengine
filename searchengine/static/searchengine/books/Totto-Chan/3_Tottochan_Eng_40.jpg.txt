The chicks all turned toward Totto-chan and raised their little heads to look at her,
 wiggling their tiny bottoms and cheeping even louder.
 &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they cute?&rdquo; Totto-chan thought she had never seen anything quite so
 appealing in all her life, and she crouched down beside them.
 &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she begged, looking up at Mother and Daddy. But to her amazement, her
 parents quickly tried to drag her away.
 &ldquo;But you said you&rsquo;d buy me something, and this is the only thing I want!&rdquo;
 &ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; said Mother quietly. &lsquo;&ldquo;These poor chicks are going to die very soon.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Totto-chan, starting to cry.
 Daddy drew her aside so the vendor couldn&rsquo;t hear, and explained, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re cute now,
 Totsky, but they&rsquo;re terribly weak, and they won&rsquo;t live long. You&rsquo;ll only cry when it
 dies. That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t want you to have one.&rdquo;
 But Totto-chan had set her heart on having a baby chick, and wouldn&rsquo;t listen.
 &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let it die! I&rsquo;ll look after it!&rdquo;
 Mother and Daddy kept trying to drag Totto-chan away from the box, bur she looked
 longingly at the chicks, and the chicks looked longingly at her, cheeping even louder
 still. Totto-chan had made up her mind that the only thing she wanted was a chick.
 She beseeched her parents, &ldquo;Please, please buy me one.
 Mother and Daddy were adamant.
 &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to have one because it will only make you cry in the end.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan burst out crying and started walking home with tears streaming down her
 cheeks. Once they were back on the dark road, she said, sobbing convulsively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
 never wanted anything so much in my whole life. I&rsquo;ll never ask you to buy me
 anything ever again. Please buy me one of those chicks!&rdquo;
 Finally Mother and Daddy gave in.
 It was like sunshine after rain. Totto-chan was all smiles now as she walked home
 carrying a small box containing two baby chicks.
 The next day, Mother had the carpenter make a special slatted box, fitted with an
 electric light bulb to keep the chicks warm. Totto-chan watched the chicks all day
 long. The little yellow chicks were very cute. But, alas, on the fourth day one of them
 stopped moving and on the fifth day the other did, too. She stroked them and called
 to them, but they didn&rsquo;t give a single &ldquo;cheep.&rdquo; She waited and waited but they never
 opened their eyes again. It was just as Mother and Daddy had said. Crying to herself,
 she dug a hole in the garden and buried the two little birds. And she laid a tiny flower
 over the spot. The box they had been in now seemed awfully big and empty.
 Catching sight of a tiny yellow feather in the corner of the box, she thought of the
