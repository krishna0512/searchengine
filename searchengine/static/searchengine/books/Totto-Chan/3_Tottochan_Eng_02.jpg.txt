&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; A splendid idea occurred to her. She looked up at Mother and informed
 her of it at the top of her voice, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I be a ticket seller who&rsquo;s really a spy!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Mother didn&rsquo;t reply. Under her felt hat with its little flowers, her lovely face was
 serious. The fact was Mother was very worried. What if they wouldn&rsquo;t have Totto-
 chan at the new school! She looked at Totto-chan skipping along the road chattering
 to herself. Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t know Mother was worried, so when their eyes met, she
 said gaily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I think I&rsquo;ll join one of those little bands of street
 musicians who go about advertising new stores!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 There was a touch of despair in Mother&rsquo;s voice as she said, &lsquo;&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll be late.
We mustn&rsquo;t keep the headmaster waiting. No more chatter. Look where you&rsquo;re going
 and walk properly.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Ahead of them, in the distance, the gate of a small school was gradually coming into
 view.
 The Little Mother at the Window
 The reason Mother was worried was because although Totto-chan had only just
 started school, she had already been expelled. Fancy being expelled from the first
 grade!
 It had happened only a week ago. Mother had been sent for by Totto-chan&rsquo;s
 homeroom teacher, who came straight to the point. &ldquo;Your daughter disrupts my
 whole class. I must ask you to take her to another school.&rdquo; The pretty young teacher
 sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really at the end of my tether.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Mother was completely taken aback. What on earth did Totto-chan do to disrupt the
 whole class, she wondered!
 Blinking nervously and touching her hair, cut in a short pageboy style, the teacher
 started to explain. &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, to begin with, she opens and shuts her desk hundreds of
 times. I&rsquo;ve said that no one is to open or shut their desk unless they have to take
 something out or put something away. So your daughter is constantly taking
 something out and putting something away - taking out or putting away her
 notebook, her pencil box, her textbooks, and everything else in her desk. For
 instance, say we are going to write the alphabet, your daughter opens her desk, takes
 out her notebook, and bangs the top down. Then she opens her desk again, puts her
 head inside, gets our a pencil, quickly shuts the desk, and writes an &rsquo;A.&rsquo; If she&rsquo;s
 written it badly or made a mistake she opens the desk again, gets out an eraser, shuts
 the desk, erases the letter, then opens and shuts the desk again to put away the eraser-
 -all at top speed. When she&rsquo;s written the &rsquo;A&rsquo; over again, she puts every single item
 back into the desk, one by one. She puts away the pencil, shuts the desk, then opens
 it again to put away the notebook. Then, when she gets to the next letter, she goes
 through it all again--first the note-book, then the pencil, then the eraser&mdash;opening and
 shutting her desk every single time. It makes my head spin. And I can&rsquo;t scold her
 because she opens and shuts it each time for a reason.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The teacher&rsquo;s long eyelashes fluttered even more as if she were reliving the scene in
 her mind.
