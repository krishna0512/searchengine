&ldquo;You mean there are only about fifty children in the whole school?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the headmaster.
 Everything about this school was different from the other one, thought Totto-chan.
 When everyone was seated, the headmaster asked the pupils if they had all brought
 something from the ocean and something from the hills.
 &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; they chorused, opening their various lunch-boxes.
 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; said the headmaster, strolling about in the circle of desks
 and looking into each box while the children squealed with delight.
 &ldquo;How funny,&rdquo; thought Totto-chan. &lsquo;&ldquo;I wonder what he means by &rsquo;something from the
 ocean and something from the hills.&rdquo;&rsquo; This school was different. It was fun. She
 never thought lunch at school could be as much fun as this. The thought that
 tomorrow she would be sitting at one of those desks, showing the headmaster her
 lunch with &ldquo;something from the ocean and something from the hills&rdquo; made Totto-
 chan so happy she wanted to jump for joy.
 As he inspected the lunchboxes, the headmaster&rsquo;s shoulders were bathed in the soft
 noontime light.
 Totto-chan Starts School
 After the headmaster had said, &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re a pupil of this school,&rdquo; Totto-chan could
 hardly wait for the next day to dawn. She had never looked forward to a day so
 much. Mother usually had trouble getting Totto-chan out of bed in the morning, but
 that day she was up before anyone else, all dressed and waiting with her schoolbag
 snapped to her back.
 The most punctual member of the household-&mdash;Rocky, the German shepherd-viewed
 Totto-chan&rsquo;s unusual behavior with suspicion, but after a good stretch, he positioned
 himself close to her, expecting something to happen.
 Mother had a lot to do. She busily made up a box lunch containing &ldquo;something from
 the ocean and something from the hills&rdquo; while she gave Totto-chan her breakfast.
 Mother also put Totto-chan&rsquo;s train pass in a plastic case and hung it around Totto-
 chan&rsquo;s neck on a cord so she wouldn&rsquo;t lose it.
 &ldquo;Be a good girl,&rdquo; said Daddy, his hair all tousled.
 &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Totto-chan put on her shoes and opened the front door, then turned
 around, bowed politely, and said, &ldquo;Goodbye, everybody.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 Tears welled up in Mother&rsquo;s eyes as she watched Totto-chan go out. It was hard to
 believe that this vivacious little girl, setting off so obediently and happily, had just
 been expelled from school. She prayed fervently that all would go well this time.
