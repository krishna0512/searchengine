 The Railroad Station
 They got off the Oimachi train at Jiyugaoka Station, and Mother took Totto-chan by
 the hand to lead her through the ticket gate. She had hardly ever been on a train
 before and was reluctant to give up the precious ticket she was clutching.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;May I keep it!&rsquo;&rdquo; Totto-chan asked the ticket collector.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rdquo; he replied, taking it from her.
 She pointed to his box filled with tickets. &ldquo;Are those all yours!&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&ldquo;No, they belong to the railroad station,&rsquo;&rdquo; he replied, as he snatched away tickets from
 people going out.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh.&rsquo;&rdquo; Totto-chan gazed longingly into the box and went on, &ldquo;When I grow up I&rsquo;m
 going to sell railroad tickets!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The ticket collector glanced at her for the first time. &ldquo;My little boy wants a job in the
 station, too, so you can work together.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Totto-chan stepped to one side and took a good look at the ticket collector. He was
 plump and wore glasses and seemed rather kind.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;Hmm.&rsquo;&rdquo; She put her hands on her hips and carefully considered the idea. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
 mind at all working with your son,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over. But I&rsquo;m rather busy
 just now as I&rsquo;m on my way to a new school.&rdquo;
 She ran to where Mother waited, shouting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a ticket seller!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Mother wasn&rsquo;t surprised, but she said, &lsquo;&ldquo;I thought you were going to be a spy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 As Totto-chan began walking along holding Mother&rsquo;s hand, she remembered that
 until the day before she had been quite sure she wanted to be a spy.
 But what fun it would be to be in charge of a box full of tickets!
