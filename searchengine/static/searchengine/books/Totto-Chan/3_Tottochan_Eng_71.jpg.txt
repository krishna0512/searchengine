Mr. Kobayashi kept on repeating, the entire time she was at Tomoe, those important
 words that probably determined the course of her whole life:
 &lsquo;&ldquo;Totto-chan, you&rsquo;re really a good girl, you know.&rsquo;&rdquo;
His Bride
 Totto-chan was very sad.
 She was in third grade now and she liked Tai-chan a lot. He was clever and good at
 physics. He studied English, and it was he who taught her the English word for fox.
 &ldquo;Totto-chan,&rdquo; he had Said, &ldquo;do yoU know what the English word for kitsune is? It&rsquo;s
 &lsquo;fox.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&lsquo;Fox.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Totto-chan had luxuriated in the sound of that word all day long. After that, the first
 thing she always did when she got to the classroom-in-the train was to sharpen all the
 pencils in Tai-chan&rsquo;s pencil box as beautifully as she could with her penknife. She
 didn&rsquo;t bother about her own, which she just hacked at with her teeth.
 In spite of all that, Tai-chan had spoken roughly to her. It happened during lunch
 break. Totto-chan was sauntering along behind the Assembly Hall in the region of
 chat notorious cesspool.
 &ldquo;Totto-chan!&rdquo;
 Tai-chan&rsquo;s voice sounded cross, and she stopped, startled. Pausing for breath, Tai-
 chan said, &ldquo;When I grow up, I&rsquo;m rot going to marry you, no matter how much you
 ask me to.&rdquo; So saying, he walked off, his eyes on the ground.
 Totto-chan stood dazed, watching until he and his large head disappeared from view.
 That head full of brains that she admired so much. That head that looked so much
 bigger than his body the children used to call him &ldquo;The Improper Fraction.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan put her hands in her pockets and thought. She could not remember doing
 anything to annoy him. In desperation she talked it over with her classmate Miyo-
 chan. After listening to Totto-chan, Miyo-chan said, maturely, &ldquo;Why, of course! It&rsquo;s
 because you threw Tai-chan out of the ring today at sumo wrestling. It&rsquo;s not
 surprising he flew out of the ring the way he did because his head&rsquo;s so heavy. But
 he&rsquo;s still bound to be mad at you.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan regretted it with all her heart. Yes, that was it. What on earth made her
 beat the boy she liked so much She Sharpened his pencils every day! But it was too
 late. She could never be his bride now.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go on sharpening his pencils all the same,&rdquo; Totto-chan decided. &ldquo;After
 all, I love him.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;&lsquo;Shabby, Old School&rsquo;&rdquo;
