rest of the little girls in her class wore their hair short, with bangs, Totto-chan wore
 hers longer, parted at the side and tied with a ribbon. Mother liked it that way, and
 besides, Totto-chan wanted it to grow so she could wear pigtails.
 Finally, one day she got Mother to braid her hair into two little pigtails. with the
 ends secured by rubber bands and tied with slender ribbons, she felt like an older
 student. when she looked at herself in the mirror, she realized that, unlike the girls in
 the train, her braids were thin and short and really looked like pigs&rsquo; tails, but she ran
 to Rocky and held them up proudly for him to see. Rocky blinked once or twice.
 &ldquo;I wish I could braid your hair, too,&rdquo; she said.
 When she got on the train she held her head as still as she could for fear the braids
 might come undone. &ldquo;How rice it would be,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;if someone noticed them
 on the train and said, What lovely braids!&rsquo;&rdquo; But nobody did. When she got to school,
 however, Miyo-chan, Sakko-chan, and Keiko Aoki, who were all in her class,
 exclaimed in unison, &ldquo;Oooh! Pigtails!&rdquo; and she was awfully pleased and let the girls
 feel them.
 None of the boys seemed impressed. But all of a sudden, after lunch, a boy from her
 class named Oe said in a loud voice, &lsquo;&ldquo;Wow! Totto-chan&rsquo;s got a new hairdo!&rdquo;
 Totto-chan was thrilled to think one of the boys had noticed, and said proudly,
 &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pigtails.&rdquo;
 Whereupon he came over, took hold of them with both hands, and said,&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired. I
 think I&rsquo;ll hang onto them for a while. Gee, they&rsquo;re much nicer than the hand snaps on
 the train!&rdquo; But that wasn&rsquo;t the end of her trouble.
 Oe was twice as big as skinny little Totto-chan. In face, he was the biggest and fattest
 boy in the class. So when he pulled on her pigtails she staggered and fell smack on
 her bottom. To have them called hand scraps was hurtful enough, without being
 dragged to the ground as well. But when Oe tried to pull her up by her pigtails, with
 a &ldquo;Heave-ho, heave-ho!&rdquo; just like at the Sports Day Tug of War, Totto-chan burst
 into tears.
 To Totto-chan, pigtails were the emblem of an older girl. She had expected everyone
 to be very polite to her because of them. Crying, she ran to the headmaster&rsquo;s office.
 When he heard her knocking on the door, sobbing, he opened it, and bent down as
 usual so their faces were level.
 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
 After checking to see if her pigtails were still properly braided, she said, &ldquo;Oe pulled
 them, saying, &rsquo;Heave-ho, heave-ho.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The headmaster looked at her hair. In contrast to her tearful face, her little pigtails
 looked as if they were dancing gaily. He sat down and had Totto-chan sit down, too,
 facing him. As usual, heedless of his missing teeth, he grinned.
 &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your hair looks lovely.
