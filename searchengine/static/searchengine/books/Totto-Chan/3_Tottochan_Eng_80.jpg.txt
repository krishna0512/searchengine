As he returned the bark to Totto-chan, he said,&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Thank you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Hooray! The headmaster&rsquo;s healthy! I&rsquo;m so glad.&rdquo;
 That day Totto-chan got everybody in the school to bite a piece of bark. Not a single
 child found it bitter, which meant they were all healthy. Totto-chan was very glad.
 The children all went and told the headmaster they were healthy, and to each child
 the headmaster replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;
 The headmaster must have known all along. He was born and bred in the heart of the
 country in Gumma Prefecture, beside a river from which you could see Mount
 Haruna. He must have known that the bark would not taste hitter, no matter who
 chewed it.
 But the headmaster thought it was rice for Totto-chan to be so glad to find that
 everyone was healthy. He was happy that Totto-chan had been brought up to be the
 kind of person who would have been worried and concerned about anyone who
 might have said the bark tasted bitter.
 Totto-chan even tried pushing the tree bark into the mouth of a stray dog walking
 near the school. She almost got bitten, but that didn&rsquo;t daunt her.
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know whether you&rsquo;re sick or not,&rdquo; she shouted at the dog. &ldquo;Come on, bite it!
 &lsquo;Cause if you&rsquo;re healthy, then that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;
 She succeeded in getting that dog she didn&rsquo;t know to bite a piece. Skipping around
 the dog she cried,
 &ldquo;Hooray! You&rsquo;re healthy, too!&rdquo;
 The dog bowed its head, as if thanking her, and ran off.
 Just as the headmaster guessed, the bark-seller never showed up in Jiyugaoka again.
 Even, morning, before she left for school, Totto-chan took the precious piece of bark
 from her drawer--it now looked as if an energetic beaver had been at it--and chewed
 some of it, calling out as she left the house, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m healthy!&rdquo;
 And, thankfully, Totto-chan was in fact healthy.
 The English-speaking Child
 A new pupil arrived at Tomoe. He was tall for an elementary school boy, and-
 broad. Totto-chan thought he looked more like a seventh grader. His clothes were
 different, too, more like grown-up ones.
 That morning in the school grounds the head-master introduced the new student.
 &ldquo;This is Miyazaki. He was born and brought up in America, so he doesn&rsquo;t speak
 Japanese very well. That&rsquo;s why he has come to Tomoe, where he will be able to make
