He replied quietly, with a gentle voice that sounded intelligent, &ldquo;I had polio.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Polio?&rdquo; Totto-chan repeated, never having heard the word before.
 &ldquo;Yes, polio,&rdquo; he whispered.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only my leg, but my hand, too.&rdquo; He held it out.
 Totto-chan looked at his left hand. His long fingers were bent and looked as if they
 were stuck together.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they do anything about it?&rdquo; she asked, concerned. He didn&rsquo;t reply, and Totto-
 chan became embarrassed, wishing she hadn&rsquo;t asked. But the boy said brightly, &ldquo;My
 name&rsquo;s Yasuaki Yamamoto. What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;
 She was so glad to hear him speak in such a cheerful voice that she replied loudly,
 &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m Totto-chan.&rdquo;
 That&rsquo;s how Yasuaki Yamamoto and Totto-chan became friends.
 The sun made it quite hot inside the train. Someone opened a window. The fresh
 spring breeze blew through the car and tossed the children&rsquo;s hair about with carefree
 abandon.
 In this way Totto-chan&rsquo;s first day at Tomoe began.
 Sea Food and Land Food
 Now it was time for &ldquo;something from the ocean and something from the hills,&rdquo; the
 lunch hour Totto-chan had looked forward to so eagerly.
 The headmaster had adopted the phrase to describe a balanced meal--the kind of food
 he expected you to bring for lunch in addition to your rice. Instead of the usual
 &ldquo;Train your children to eat everything,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Please see that they bring a nutritiously
 balanced lunch,&rdquo; this headmaster asked parents to include in their children&rsquo;s
 lunchboxes &ldquo;something from the ocean and something from the hills.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Something from the ocean&rdquo; meant sea food-- things such as fish and tsukuda-ni
(tiny crustaceans and the like boiled in soy sauce and sweet sake), while &ldquo;something
 from the hills&rdquo; meant food from the land--like vegetables, beef, pork, and chicken.
 Mother was very impressed by this and thought that few headmasters were capable
 of expressing such an important rule so simply. Oddly enough, just having to choose
 from two categories made preparing lunch seem simpler. And besides, the
 headmaster pointed out that one did not have to think too hard or be extravagant to
 fulfill the two requirements. The land food could be just kinpira gobo (spicy
 burdock) or an omelette, and the sea food merely flakes of dried bonito. Or simpler
 still, you could have nori (a kind of seaweed) for &ldquo;ocean&rdquo; and a pickled plum for
 &ldquo;hills.&rdquo;
 Just as the day before, when Totto-chan had watched so enviously, the headmaster
 came and looked in all the lunchboxes.
