It suddenly dawned on Mother why Totto-chan opened and shut her desk so often.
 She remembered how excited Totto-chan had been when she came home from her
 first day at school. She had said, &ldquo;School&rsquo;s wonderful! My desk at home has drawers
 you pull out, but the one at school has a top you lift up. It&rsquo;s like a box, and you can
 keep all sorts of things inside. It&rsquo;s super!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Mother pictured her delightedly opening and shutting the lid of this new desk. And
 Mother didn&rsquo;t think it was all that naughty either. Anyway, Totto-chan would
 probably stop doing it as soon as the novelty wore off. But all she said to the teacher
 was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to her about it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The teacher&rsquo;s voice rose in pitch as she continued, &lsquo;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if that was all.&rdquo;
 Mother flinched as the teacher leaned forward.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;When she&rsquo;s not making a clatter with her desk, she&rsquo;s standing up. All through class!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&ldquo;Standing up! Where?&rdquo; asked Mother, surprised.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;At the window,&rsquo;&rdquo; the teacher replied crossly.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;Why does she stand at the window?&rdquo; Mother asked, puzzled.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;So she can invite the street musicians over!&rsquo;&rsquo; she almost shrieked.
 The gist of the teacher&rsquo;s story was that after an hour of almost constantly banging her
 desk top, Totto-chan would leave her desk and stand by the window, looking out.
 Then, just as the teacher was beginning to think that as long as she was quiet she
 might just as well stay there, Totto-chan would suddenly call out to a passing band of
 garishly dressed street musicians. To Totto-chan&rsquo;s delight and the teacher&rsquo;s
 tribulation, the classroom was on the ground floor looking out on the street. There
 was only a low hedge in between, so anyone in the classroom could easily talk to
 people going by. When Totto-chan called to them, the street musicians would come
 right over to the window. Whereupon, said the teacher, Totto-chan would announce
 the fact to the whole room, &ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; and all the children would crowd by the
 window and call out to the musicians.
 &ldquo;Play something,&rdquo; Totto-chan would say, and the little band, which usually passed
 the school quietly, would put on a rousing performance for the pupils with their
 clarinet, gongs, drums, and samisen, while the poor teacher could do little but wait
 patiently for the din to stop.
 Finally, when the music finished, the musicians would leave and the students would
 go back to their seats. All except Totto-chan. When the teacher asked, &ldquo;Why are you
 still at the window?&rdquo; Totto-chan replied, quite seriously, &ldquo;Another band might come
 by. And, anyway, it would be such a shame if the others came back and we missed
 them.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;You can see how disruptive all this is, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the teacher emotionally.
 Mother was beginning to sympathize with her when she began again in an even
 shriller voice, &ldquo;And then, besides...
