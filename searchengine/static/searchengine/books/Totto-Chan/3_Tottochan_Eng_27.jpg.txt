The Report Card
 Looking neither right nor left, her bag flapping against her back, Totto-chan ran all
 the way home from the station. Anyone seeing her would have thought something
 terrible had happened. She had started running as soon as she was out of the school
gate.
 Once home, she opened the front door and called out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back!&rdquo; and went to look
 for Rocky. He was lying on the porch, cooling off, with his belly flat against the
 floor. Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t say a word. She sat down in front of Rocky, took her bag off
 her back, and took out a report card. It was her very first report card. She opened it so
 Rocky could clearly see her marks.
 &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she said proudly. There were A&rsquo;s and 8&rsquo;s and other characters. Naturally,
 Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t know yet whether A was better than B or whether 8 was better than
 A, so it would have been even harder for Rocky to know. But Totto-chan wanted to
 show her very first report card to Rocky before anyone else, and she was sure Rocky
 would be delighted.
 When Rocky saw the paper in front of his face, he sniffed it, then gazed up at Totto-
 chan.
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;re impressed, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Totto-chan. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s full of difficult words so
 you probably can&rsquo;t read all of it.&rdquo;
 Rocky tilted his head as if he was having another good look at the card. Then he
 licked Totto-chan&rsquo;s hand.
 &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she said with satisfaction, getting up. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go and show it to Mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 After Totto-chan had gone, Rocky got up and found himself a cooler spot. Then he
 let himself down again slowly, and closed his eyes. It wasn&rsquo;t only Totto-chan who
 would have said that the way his eyes were closed it really seemed as if he was
 thinking about that report card.
 Summer Vacation Begins
 &ldquo;We are going camping tomorrow. Please come to the school in the evening with
 blankets and pajamas,&rdquo; said the note from the headmaster that Totto-chan took home
 and showed to Mother. Summer vacation began the following day.
 &ldquo;What does camping mean?&rdquo; asked Totto-chan.
 Mother was wondering, too, but she replied, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it mean you&rsquo;re probably going
 to put up tents somewhere outdoors and sleep in them? Sleeping in a tent you can see
 the moon and the stars. I wonder where they&rsquo;ll set up the tents. There&rsquo;s no mention of
 fares so it&rsquo;s probably somewhere near the school.&rdquo;
 That night, after Totto-chan had gone to bed, she couldn&rsquo;t get to sleep for ages. The
 idea of going camping sounded rather scary--a tremendous adventure-and her heart
 beat very fast.
