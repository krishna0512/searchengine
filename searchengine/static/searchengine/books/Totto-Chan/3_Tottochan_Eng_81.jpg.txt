friends more easily and take his time over his studies. He&rsquo;s one of you now. What
 grade
 shall we put him in! what about fifth grade, with Ta-chan and the others!&rdquo;
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Ta-chan - who was good at drawing--in a big-brotherly voice.
 The headmaster smiled and went on, &ldquo;I said he wasn&rsquo;t very good at Japanese, but he&rsquo;s
 very good at English. Get him to teach you some. He&rsquo;s not used to life in Japan,
 though, so you&rsquo;ll help him, won&rsquo;t you? And ask him about life in America. He&rsquo;ll be
 able to tell you all sorts of interesting things. well, then, I&rsquo;ll leave him with you.&rdquo;
Miyazaki bowed to his classmates, who were all much smaller than he was. And all
 the children, not only the children in Ta-chan&rsquo;s class, bowed back.
 At lunchtime Miyazaki went over to the head-master&rsquo;s house, and all the others
 followed him. Then what did he do but start to walk into the house with his shoes on!
 All the children shouted at him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to take off your shoes?&rdquo;
Miyazaki seemed startled. &ldquo;Oh, excuse me,&rdquo; he said, taking them off.
 The children began telling him what to do, all talking at once.
 &ldquo;You have to take your shoes off for rooms with tatami-matted floors and for the
 Assembly Hall. You can keep them on in the classrooms and in the library.
 &ldquo;When you go to Kuhonbutsu Temple you can keep them on in the courtyard but you
 have to take them off in the temple.&rdquo;
 It was fun learning about the differences between living in Japan and living abroad.
 Next day Miyazaki brought a big English picture book to school. They all clustered
 around him at lunchtime to look at the book. They were amazed. They had never
 seen such a beautiful picture book More. The picture books they knew were only
 printed in bright reds, greens, and yellows, but this one had pale flesh-colored pinks.
 As for the blues, they were lovely shades, mixed with white and gray--colors that
 didn&rsquo;t exist in crayons. There were lots of colors besides the standard twenty-four in a
 box of crayons, colors that were not even in Ta-chan&rsquo;s special box of forty-eight.
 Everyone was impressed. As for the pictures, the first one was of a dog pulling a
 baby by its diaper. What impressed them was that the baby didn&rsquo;t look as if it was
 painted but had soft pink skin just like a teal baby. They had never seen a picture
 book that was so big and printed on such lovely, thick, shiny paper. In her usual
 sociable way, Totto-chan got as close to Miyazaki and the picture book as she could..
Miyazaki read the English text to them. The English language sounded so smooth
 that they listened enraptured. Then Miyazaki began to grapple with Japanese.
Miyazaki certainly had brought something new and different to the school.
 &ldquo;Akachan is baby,&rdquo; he began.
 They all repeated it after him. &ldquo;Akachan is baby.&rsquo;&rsquo;
