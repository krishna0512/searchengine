Time went by and she still hadn&rsquo;t found the purse.
 The foul-smelling pile was getting higher and higher.
 The headmaster came by again. &ldquo;Have you found it?&rdquo; he inquired.
 &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Totto-chan, from the center of the pile, sweating profusely, her cheeks
 flushed.
 The headmaster came closer and said in a friendly tone, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll put it all back when
 you&rsquo;ve finished, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Then he went off again, as he had done before.
 &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Totto-chan replied cheerfully, as she went on with her work. Suddenly a
 thought struck her. She looked at the pile. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve finished I can put all the solid
 stuff back, but what do I do about the water?&rdquo;
 The liquid portion was disappearing fast into the earth. Totto-chan stopped working
 and tried to figure out how she could get that part back into the tank, too, since she
 had promised the headmaster to put it all back. She finally decided the thing to do
 was to put in some of the wet earth.
 The pile was a real mountain by now and the tank was almost empty, but there was
 still no sign of the purse. Maybe it had stuck to the rim of the tank or to the bottom.
 But Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t care. She was satisfied she had done all she could. Totto-chan&rsquo;s
 satisfaction was undoubtedly due in part to the self-respect the headmaster made her
 feel by not scolding her and by trusting her. But that was too complicated for Totto-
 chan to realize then.
 Most adults, on discovering Totto-chan in such a situation, would have reacted by
 exclaiming, &ldquo;What on earth are you doing!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stop that, it&rsquo;s dangerous!&rdquo; or,
 alternatively, offering to help.
 Imagine just saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll put it all back when you&rsquo;ve finished, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&rdquo; What a
 marvelous headmaster, thought Mother when she heard the story from Totto-chan.
 After the incident, Totto-chan never peered down the hole any more after using the
 toilet. And she felt the headmaster was someone she could trust completely, and she
 liked him more than ever.
 Totto-chan kept her promise and put everything back into the tank. It was a terrible
 job getting it out, but putting it back was much quicker. She put some of the wet
 earth in, too. Then she smoothed the ground, put the cover back properly, and took
 the ladle back to the janitor&rsquo;s shed.
 That night before she went to bed Totto-chan thought about the beautiful purse she
 had dropped into the darkness. She was sad about losing it, but the day&rsquo;s exertion had
 made her so tired it was not long before she was fast asleep.
 Meanwhile, at the scene of her toil, the damp earth shimmered in the moonlight like
 some beautiful thing.
 And somewhere the purse rested quietly.
