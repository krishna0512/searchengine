The school they were on their way to was one Mother had found after a good deal of
 searching.
 Mother did not tell Totto-chan she had been expelled. She realized Totto-chan
 wouldn&rsquo;t understand what she had done wrong and she didn&rsquo;t want her to get any
 complexes, so she decided not to tell Totto-chan until she was grown-up. All Mother
 said was, &ldquo;How would you like to go to a new school! I&rsquo;ve heard of a very nice one.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Totto-chan, after thinking it over.
 &lsquo;&lsquo;But...&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; thought Mother. &lsquo;&ldquo;Does she realize she&rsquo;s been expelled?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 But a moment later Totto-chan was asking joyfully, &ldquo;Do you think the street
 musicians will come to the new school?&rdquo;
 The New School
 When she saw the gate of the new school, Totto-chan stopped. The gate of the school
 she used to go to had fine concrete pillars with the name of the school in large
 characters. But the gate of this new school simply consisted of two rather short posts
 that still had twigs and leaves on them.
 &ldquo;This gate&rsquo;s growing,&rdquo; said Totto-chan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll probably go on growing till it&rsquo;s taller
 than the telephone poles!&rdquo;
 The two &ldquo;gateposts&rdquo; were clearly trees with roots. When she got closer, she had to
 put her head to one side to read the name of the school because the wind had blown
 the sign askew.
 &ldquo;To-mo-e Ga-ku-en.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan was about to ask Mother what &lsquo;&ldquo;Tomoe&rsquo;&rdquo; meant, when she caught a
 glimpse of something that made her think she must be dreaming. She squatted down
 and peered through the shrubbery to get a better look, and she couldn&rsquo;t believe her 
eyes
 &ldquo;Mother, is that really a train! There, in the school grounds!&rdquo;
 For its classrooms, the school had made use of six abandoned railroad cars. To Totto-
 chan it seemed something you might dream about. A school in a train!
 The windows of the railroad cars sparkled in the morning sunlight. But the eyes of
 the rosy-cheeked little girl gazing at them through the shrubbery sparkled even
more
 "I Like This School"
 A moment later, Totto-chan let out a whoop of joy and started running toward the
 &ldquo;train school,&rdquo; calling out to Mother over her shoulder, &ldquo;Come on, hurry, let&rsquo;s get on
 this train that&rsquo;s standing still.&rdquo;
