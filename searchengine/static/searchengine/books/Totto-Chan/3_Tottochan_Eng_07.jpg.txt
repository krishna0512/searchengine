His hair was thin on top and he had a few teeth missing, but his face was a healthy
 color. Although he wasn&rsquo;t very tall, he had solid shoulders and arms and was neatly
 dressed in a rather shabby black three-piece suit.
 With a hasty bow, Totto-chan asked him spiritedly &ldquo;what are you, a schoolmaster or
 a stationmaster?&rdquo;
 Mother was embarrassed, but before she had time to explain, he laughed and replied,
 &lsquo;&lsquo;1&rsquo;m the head-master of this school.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan was delighted. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; she said, &lsquo;&ldquo;because I want to ask you a
 favor. I&rsquo;d like to come to your school.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The headmaster offered her a chair and turned to Mother. &ldquo;You may go home now. I
 want to talk to Totto-chan.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan had a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness, but somehow felt she would get along all
 right with this man. &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll leave her with you,&rdquo; Mother said bravely, and
 shut the door behind her as she went out.
 The headmaster drew over a chair and put it facing Totto-chan, and when they were
 both sitting down close together, he said, &ldquo;Now then, tell me all about yourself. Tell
 me anything at all you want to talk about.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Anything I like?&rdquo; Totto-chan had expected him to ask questions she would have to
 answer. When he said she could talk about anything she wanted, she was so happy
 she began straight away. It was all a bit higgledy-piggledy, but she talked for all she
 was worth. She told the headmaster how fast the train went that they had come on;
 how she had asked the ticket collector but he wouldn&rsquo;t let her keep her ticket; how
 pretty her homeroom teacher was at the other school; about the swallows&rsquo; nest; about
 their brown dog, Rocky, who could do all sorts of tricks; how she used to go snip-
 snip with the scissors inside her mouth at kindergarten and the teacher said she
 mustn&rsquo;t do that because she might cut her tongue off, but she did it anyway; how she
 always blew her nose because Mother scolded her if it was runny; what a good
 swimmer Daddy was, and how he could dive as well. She went on and on. The
 headmaster would laugh, nod, and say, &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; And Totto-chan was so happy
 she kept right on talking. But finally she ran out of things to say. She sat with her
 mouth closed trying hard to think of something.
 &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you anything more you can tell me?&rdquo; asked the headmaster.
 What a shame to stop now, Totto-chan thought. It was such a wonderful chance.
 Wasn&rsquo;t there anything else she could talk about, she wondered, racking her brains?
 Then she had an idea.
 She could tell him about the dress she was wearing that day. Mother made most of
 her dresses, but this one came from a shop. Her clothes were always torn when she
 came home in the late afternoon. Some of the rips were quite bad. Mother never
 knew how they got that way. Even her white cotton panties were sometimes in
 shreds. She explained to the headmaster that they got torn when she crossed other
 people&rsquo;s gardens by crawling under their fences, and when she burrowed under the
