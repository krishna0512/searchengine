&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the man, glancing at the young school child.
 Totto-chan ran off, her bag flapping against her back. She didn&rsquo;t want to be late since
 there was something she had to do before school began. She had to ask the children
 something the moment she got to her classroom.
 &ldquo;Can anybody lend me twenty sen?&rdquo;
 But nobody had twenty sen. One of those long packers of caramels only cost ten sen,
 so it wasn&rsquo;t very much money, really, but nobody had it.
 &ldquo;Shall I ask my parents?&rdquo; asked Miyo-chan.
 At times like these it was very convenient that Miyo-chan happened to be the
 daughter of the head-master. Miyo-chan&rsquo;s house adjoined-the Assembly Hall, so it
 was just as if her mother lived at the school.
 &ldquo;Daddy says he&rsquo;ll lend it to you,&rdquo; she told Totto-chan at lunchtime, &ldquo;but he wants to
 know what it&rsquo;s for.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan made her way to the office.
 &ldquo;So you want twenty sen,&rdquo; he said, taking off his glasses. &ldquo;What do you want it for?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;I want to buy a piece of bark that tells you whether you&rsquo;re sick or whether you&rsquo;re
 well,&rdquo; she replied quickly. The headmaster&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused.
 &ldquo;Where are they selling them?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;In front of the station,&rdquo; she replied, in a great hurry.
 &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the headmaster. &ldquo;Buy one if you want. But let me have a bite, won&rsquo;t
 you?&rdquo;
 He took a purse out of his jacket pocket and placed twenty sen in Totto-chan&rsquo;s palm.
 &ldquo;Oh, thank you so much!&rdquo; said Totto-chan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the money from Mother and pay
 you back. She always gives me money for books. If I want to buy anything else I
 have to ask first, but health bark is something everybody needs so I&rsquo;m sure she won&rsquo;t
 mind.&rdquo;
 When school was over, Totto-chan hurried to the station, clutching her twenty sen.
 The man was still there, extolling his product in a loud patter. When he saw the
 twenty sen in Totto-chan&rsquo;s hand, he broke into a broad grin.
 &ldquo;Good girl! Your mother and father will be pleased.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;So will Rocky,&rdquo; said Totto-chan.
 &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Rocky?&rsquo; asked the man, as he picked out a piece of bark for Totto-chan.
 &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our dog. He&rsquo;s a German shepherd.&rdquo;
