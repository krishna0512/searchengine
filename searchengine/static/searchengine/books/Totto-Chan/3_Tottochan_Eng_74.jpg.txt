to say she met the headmaster when he had been with them all through lunch, but
 she met him because he was coming from the opposite direction.
 &ldquo;Oh, there you are,&rdquo; said the headmaster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to ask you something.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Totto-chan, delighted to think she could give the headmaster
 some information.
 &ldquo;Where did you get that ribbon?&rdquo; he asked, looking at the bow she had in her hair.
 The expression on Totto-chan&rsquo;s face when she heard that couldn&rsquo;t have been a
 happier one. She had been wearing the bow since the day before. It was something
 she had found herself. She went up closer so the headmaster could see the ribbon
 better.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;It was on my aunt&rsquo;s old school uniform,&rdquo; she said proudly. &ldquo;I noticed it when she
 was putting it in a drawer and she gave it to me. Auntie said I was very observant.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the headmaster, deep in thought.
 Totto-chan was very proud of the ribbon. She told him how she had Bone to see her
 aunt and was lucky to find her aunt airing some clothes. Among them was the old-
 fashioned, long, purple pleated skirt she had worn when she was a schoolgirl. As her
 aunt was putting it away, Totto-chan noticed something pretty on it.
 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
 At Totto-chan&rsquo;s question, her aunt paused. The something pretty turned out to be this
 ribbon that was attached to the waistband at the back.
 &ldquo;It was supposed to make you look pretty from the back,&rdquo; said Auntie. &ldquo;In those days
 everyone wanted to put a piece of handmade lace there or a wide ribbon tied in a big
 bow.
 She noticed how longingly Totto-chan gazed at the bow as she listened, stroking it
 and feeling it, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it to you. I shan&rsquo;t be wearing it again.&rdquo;
 She took some scissors and cut the thread attaching it to the skirt and gave it to
 Totto-chan. That was how she got it. It really was a beautiful ribbon. It was wide and
 of very good silk, and had roses and all sorts of designs woven into it. wide and stiff
 when it was tied, if made a bow as big as Totto-chan&rsquo;s head. Auntie said the fabric
 was imported.
 While she was speaking, Totto-chan jiggled her head occasionally so the headmaster
 could hear the rustling sound the ribbon made. When he had heard her story, the
 headmaster looked a little distressed.
 &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yesterday Miyo-chan said she wanted a ribbon just like yours,
 so I went to all the ribbon shops in Jiyugaoka, but they didn&rsquo;t have anything like it.
 So that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s imported, is it?&rdquo;
