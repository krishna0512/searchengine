That afternoon no one could concentrate on the lessons. After school, the children in
 Totto-chan&rsquo;s class went straight home, all hoping they&rsquo;d be lucky enough to see each
 other again that night complete with pajamas and blankets.
 As soon as she reached home, Totto-chan said to Mother, &ldquo;A train&rsquo;s coming. We
 don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to get there. Pajamas and a blanket. May I go?&rdquo;
 What mother could grasp the situation with that kind of explanation! Totto-chan&rsquo;s
 mother had no idea what she meant. But judging by the serious look on her
 daughter&rsquo;s face, she guessed something unusual was afoot.
 Mother asked Totto-chan all sorts of questions. She finally discovered what it was all
 about and what exactly was going to happen. She thought Totto-chan ought to see it,
 as she wouldn&rsquo;t have many such opportunities. She even thought she&rsquo;d like to see the
 car arrive herself.
 Mother got out Totto-chan&rsquo;s pajamas and a blanket, and after dinner she took her to
 the school. About ten children were there. They included some of the older students
 who had heard of the event. A couple of other mothers, too, had come with their
 children. They looked as if they would like to stay, but after entrusting their children
 to the head-master&rsquo;s care, they went home.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wake you up when it comes,&rdquo; the children were assured by the headmaster as
 they lay down in the Assembly Hall wrapped in their blankets.
 The children thought they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sleep for wondering how the train
 would get there.
 But after so much excitement, they were tired and soon became drowsy. Before they
 could say, &ldquo;Be sure and wake me up,&rdquo; most of them fell fast asleep.
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here! It&rsquo;s here!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Awakened by a babble of voices, Totto-chan jumped up and ran through the school
 grounds and out the gate. A great big railroad car was just visible in the morning
 haze. It was like a dream--a train coming along the road without tracks making no
 sound.
 It had come on a large trailer pulled by a tractor from the Oimachi Line depot. Totto-
 chan and the others learned something they didn&rsquo;t know before-that there was
 something called a tractor that could pull a trailer, which was much bigger than a
 cart. They were impressed.
 The car moved slowly along the deserted morning road mounted on the trailer.
 Soon there was a great commotion. There were no giant cranes in those days, so to
 get the car off the trailer and to its destination in the school grounds was a
 tremendous operation. The men who brought it had to lay several big logs under the
 car and gradually roll it off the trailer onto the schoolyard.
 &ldquo;Watch carefully,&rdquo; said the headmaster, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re called rollers. Rolling power is
 being used to move that big car.&rsquo;&rdquo;
