After listening to Totto-chan sing the song from the other school and after
 considering the children&rsquo;s request, the headmaster said, &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll have a school
 song for you by tomorrow morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Promise you will!&rdquo; chorused the children, and they filed out to return to their
 classroom.
 Next morning, there was a notice in each classroom requiring everyone to assemble
 in the school grounds. Totto-chan joined the others, all agog. Bringing a blackboard
 out into the center of the grounds, the headmaster said, &ldquo;Now then, here&rsquo;s a song for
 Tomoe, your school.&rdquo; He drew five parallel lines on the blackboard and wrote out the
 following notes:
 Then he raised both his arms like a conductor, saying, &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s try and sing it, all
 together!&rdquo;
 While the headmaster beat time and led the singing, the whole school, all fifty
 students, joined in:
 To-mo-e, To-mo-e, To-mo-e&rsquo;
 &ldquo;Is that all there is?&rdquo; asked Totto-chan, after a brief pause.
 &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the headmaster, proudly.
 &ldquo;Something with fancy words would have been nicer,&rdquo; said Totto-chan in a terribly
 disappointed voice. &ldquo;Something like Tho&rsquo; shallow the waters of Senzoku Pond.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; asked the headmaster, flushed but smiling.&ldquo;I thought it was
 rather good.&rdquo;
 Nobody liked it. It was far too simple. They&rsquo;d rather have no song at all, it appeared,
 than anything as simple as that.
 The headmaster seemed rather sorry, but he wasn&rsquo;t angry, and proceeded to wipe it
 off the blackboard. Totto-chan felt that they had been rather rude, but after all she
 had something a bit more impressive in mind.
 The truth was that nothing could have expressed the headmaster&rsquo;s love for the
 children and the school more, but the children weren&rsquo;t old enough to realize that.
 They soon forgot about wanting a school song, and the headmaster probably never
 considered one necessary in the first place. So when the tune had been rubbed off the
 blackboard, that was the end of the matter, and Tomoe Gakuen never did have a
 school song.
"Put It All Back!"
 Totto-chan had never labored so hard in her life. What a day that was when she
 dropped her favorite purse down the toilet! It had no money in it, but Totto-chan
 loved the purse so much she even took it to the toilet with her. It was a truly beautiful
