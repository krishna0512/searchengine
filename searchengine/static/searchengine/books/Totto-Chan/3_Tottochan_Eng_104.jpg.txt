no matter what elementary school he attended. But I think the Tomoe system of
 letting children work on subjects in any order they wanted probably helped to
 develop his talent. I cannot remember him doing anything during class but working
 with his alcohol burner and his flasks and test tubes or reading terribly difficult-
 looking books on science and physics.
Kunio Oe
 Oe, the boy who pulled my braids, is now Japan&rsquo;s foremost authority on Far Eastern
 orchids, whose bulbs can cost tens of thousands of dollars. His is a very specialized
 field, and Oe is in great demand and constantly travels all over Japan. It was with
 difficulty that I managed to get hold of him by telephone in between trips and have
 the following brief conversation:
 &ldquo;Where did you go to school after Tomoe?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go anywhere.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go anywhere else? Tomoe was your only school?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Good heavens! Didn&rsquo;t you even go to secondary school?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Oh yes, I did spend a few months at Oita Secondary School when I was evacuated
 to Kyushu.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t finishing secondary school compulsory?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;My! How happy-go-lucky he is,&rdquo; I thought. Before the war, Oe&rsquo;s father owned an
 enormous nursery garden that encompassed most of the area called Todoroki in
 southwest Tokyo, but it was all destroyed in the bombing. Oe&rsquo;s placid nature was
 evident in the rest of our conversation as he changed the subject.
 &ldquo;Do you know what&rsquo;s the most fragrant flower? To my mind it&rsquo;s the Chinese spring
 orchid (Cymbidium virescens). No perfume can match it.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Are they expensive?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Some are and some aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&ldquo;What do they look like?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re not a bit showy. They&rsquo;re rather subdued. But that&rsquo;s their charm.&rdquo;
 He hadn&rsquo;t changed a bit since he was at Tomoe.
 Listening to Oe&rsquo;s relaxed voice I thought, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bother him one bit, the fact that
 he never even graduated from secondary school! He just does his own thing and
 really believes in himself.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help being impressed.
