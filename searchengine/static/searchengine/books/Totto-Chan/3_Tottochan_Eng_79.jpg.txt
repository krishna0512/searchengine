The man stopped and thought for a minute, then said, &ldquo;A dog... well, I suppose it&rsquo;ll
 work with a dog, too. After all, if it&rsquo;s bitter he won&rsquo;t like it and that&rsquo;ll mean he&rsquo;s ill.&rdquo;
 The man picked out a piece of bark about one inch wide and six inches long.
 &ldquo;Here you are. Bite some every morning and if it&rsquo;s bitter, you&rsquo;re sick. If not, you&rsquo;re as
 fit as a fiddle!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Totto-chan went home carefully carrying the precious bark wrapped in newspaper.
 The first thing she did when she got there was to take a small bite. It was dry and
 rough, but not bitter. In fact it didn&rsquo;t taste of anything at all.
 &ldquo;Hooray! I&rsquo;m healthy!&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; said Mother, smiling. &ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
 Totto-chan explained. Mother tried biting a piece of the bark, too.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bitter.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re healthy, too, Mother!&rdquo;
 Then Totto-chan went over to Rocky and held the bark to his mouth. First Rocky
 sniffed it. Then he licked it.
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to bite it,&rdquo; said Totto-chan. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll know whether you&rsquo;re sick or
 not.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 But Rocky made no attempt to bite it. He just scratched the back of his ear with his
 paw. Totto-chan held the tree bark closer to his mouth.
 &ldquo;Come on, bite it! It would be terrible if you weren&rsquo;t well.&rdquo;
 Rocky reluctantly bit a tiny piece off the edge. Then he sniffed it again, but he didn&rsquo;t
 look as if he particularly disliked it. He just let out a big yawn.
 &ldquo;Hooray! Rocky&rsquo;s healthy, too!&rdquo;
 Next morning, Mother gave Totto-chan twenty sen. She went straight to the
 headmaster&rsquo;s office and thrust out the tree bark.
 For a moment the headmaster looked at it as if to say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this!&rdquo; Then he saw the
 twenty sen Totto-chan had brought him, clutched carefully in her hand, and
 remembered.
 &ldquo;Bite it,&rdquo; said Totto-chan. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s bitter, it means you&rsquo;re ill.&rdquo;
 The headmaster bit some. Then he turned the bark over and studied it carefully.
 &ldquo;Does- it taste bitter?&rdquo; asked Totto-chan, concerned, looking at the headmaster&rsquo;s face.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t any taste at all.&rdquo;
