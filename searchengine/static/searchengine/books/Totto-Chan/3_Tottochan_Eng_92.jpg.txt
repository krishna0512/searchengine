Mother seemed at a loss for words. just after you left for Kamakura,&rdquo; she began,
 sadly. Then she hurriedly continued, &ldquo;We looked for him. We went everywhere. And
 we asked everybody. But we couldn&rsquo;t find him. I&rsquo;ve been wondering how to tell you.
 I&rsquo;m terribly sorry. Then the truth dawned on Totto-chan. Rocky must have died.
 &ldquo;Mother doesn&rsquo;t want me to be sad,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;but Rocky&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
 It was quite clear to Totto-chan. Up till now, no matter how long Totto-chan was
 gone, Rocky never went far from the house. He always knew she would come back.
 &ldquo;Rocky would never go off like that without telling me,&rdquo; she thought to herself. It
 was a strong conviction.
 But Totto-chan did not discuss it with Mother. She knew how Mother must feel. &ldquo;1
 wonder where he went,&rdquo; was all she said, keeping her eyes lowered.
 It was all she could do to say that much, and then she ran upstairs to her room.
 Without Rocky, the house didn&rsquo;t seem like their house at all. When she got to her
 room, she tried hard not to cry and thought about it once more. She wondered
 whether she had done anything mean to Rocky&mdash;anything that would make him want
 to leave.
 &ldquo;Never tease animals,&rdquo; Mr. Kobayashi always told the children at Tomoe. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s cruel
 to betray animals when they trust you. Don&rsquo;t make a dog beg and then not give it
 anything. The dog won&rsquo;t trust you any more and might develop a bad nature.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan always obeyed these rules. She had never deceived Rocky. She had done
 nothing wrong that she could think of.
 Just then Totto-chan noticed something clinging to the leg of her teddy bear on the
 floor. She had managed not to cry until then, but when she saw it she burst into tears.
 It was a little tuft of Rocky&rsquo;s light brown hair. It must have come off when the two of
 them had rolled about on the floor, playing, the morning she left for Kamakura. With
 those few little German shepherd hairs clutched in her hand, she cried and cried. Her
 tears and her sobbing just wouldn&rsquo;t stop.
 First Yasuaki-chan and now Rocky. Totto-chan had lost another friend.
 The Tea Party
 Ryo-chan, the janitor at Tomoe, whom all the children liked so much, was finally
 called up. He was a grown-up, but they all called him by his childish nickname. Ryo-
 chan was a sort of guardian angel who always came to the rescue and helped when
 anyone was in trouble. Ryo-chan could do anything. He never said much, and only
 smiled, but he always knew just what to do. wWhen Totto-chan fell into the cesspool,
 it was Ryo-chan who came to her rescue straight away, and washed her off without
 so much as a grumble.
 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give Ryo-chan a rousing, send-off tea party,&rdquo; said the headmaster.
 A tea party?&rdquo;
 Green tea is drunk many times during the day in Japan, but it is not associated with
 entertaining--except ceremonial powdered tea, a different beverage altogether. A &ldquo;tea
