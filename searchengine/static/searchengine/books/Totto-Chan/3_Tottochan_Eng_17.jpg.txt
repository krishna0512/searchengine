Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t think so either, but like the other children, she was sure that pistils
 and stamens were very important.
 After they had walked for about another ten minutes, a thickly wooded park came
 into view. It surrounded the temple called Kuhonbutsu. As they entered the grounds
 the children scattered in various directions.
 &ldquo;Want to see the shooting-star well?&rdquo; asked Sakko-chan, and naturally Totto-chan
 agreed and ran after her.
 The well looked as if it was made of stone and came up to their chests. It had a
 wooden lid. They lifted the lid and peered in. It was pitch dark, and Totto-chan could
 see something like a lump of concrete or stone, but nothing whatsoever resembling
 the twinkling star she had imagined. After staring inside for a long time, she asked,
 &ldquo;Have you seen the star?&rdquo;
 Sakko-chan shook her head. &lsquo;&lsquo;No, never.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Totto-chan wondered why it didn&rsquo;t shine. After thinking about it for a while, she said,
 &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;
 Opening her big round eyes even wider, Sakko-chan asked, &ldquo;Do stars sleep?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;I think they must sleep in the daytime and then wake up at night and shine,&rdquo; said
 Totto-chan quickly because she wasn&rsquo;t really sure.
 Then the children gathered together and walked around the temple grounds. They
 laughed at the bare bellies of the two Deva Kings that stood on either side of the
 gate, guarding the temple, and gazed with awe at the statue of Buddha in the semi-
 darkness of the Main Hall. They placed their feet in the great footprint in a stone said
 to have been made by a Tengu - a long-nosed goblin. They strolled around the pond,
 calling out &ldquo;Hello!&rsquo;&rdquo; to the people in rowboats. And they played hopscotch to their
 hearts&rsquo; content with the glossy black pebbles around the graves. Everything was new
 to Totto-chan, and she greeted each discovery with an excited shout.
 &ldquo;Time to go back!&rdquo; said the teacher, as the sun began to dip, and the children set off
 for the school along the road between the mustard blossoms and the cherry trees.
 Little did the children realize then that these walks--a time of freedom and play for
 them--were in reality precious lessons in science, history, and biology.
 Totto-chan had already made friends with all the children and felt she had known
 them all her life.
 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a walk again tomorrow!&rdquo; she shouted to them all on the way back.
 &ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s!&rdquo; they shouted back, hopping and skipping.
 The butterflies were still going busily about their business, and the song of birds
 filled the air. Totto-chan&rsquo;s heart was bursting with joy.
