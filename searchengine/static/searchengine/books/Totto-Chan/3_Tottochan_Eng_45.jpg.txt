One day the headmaster said, &ldquo;I think we all ought to learn how to speak better. What
 do you think? After this, while we are eating our lunch, let&rsquo;s have somebody different
 each day stand in the middle of the circle and tell us about something. How about
 that?&rdquo;
 Some children thought they weren&rsquo;t very good at speaking, but it would be fun to
 listen to others. Some thought it would be super to tell people things they knew.
 Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t know what she would talk about but was willing to give it a try.
 Most of the children were in favor of the idea so they decided to start the talks the
next day.
 Japanese children are usually taught at home rot to talk at mealtimes. But as a result
 of his experience abroad, the headmaster used to encourage his pupils to take plenty
 of time over their meals and enjoy conversation.
 Besides that, he thought it was essential for them to learn how to get up in front of
 people and express their ideas clearly and freely without being embarrassed, so he
 decided it was time to put this theory into practice.
 After the children had agreed to the idea, this is what he told them. Totto-chan
 listened attentively.
 &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about trying to be a good speaker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you can talk
 about anything you like. You can talk about things you&rsquo;d like to do. Anything. At any
 rate, let&rsquo;s give it a try.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 The order of speakers was decided upon. And it was also decided that whoever was
 going to speak that day would eat lunch quickly, straight away after the song was
over.
 The children soon discovered that unlike talking to two or three friends during lunch
 hour, standing up in the middle of the whole school needed a good deal of courage
 and was quite difficult. Some children were so shy at first that they just giggled. One
 boy had gone to a lot of effort and prepared a talk only to forget all of it the moment
 he stood up. He repeated several times his fine-sounding title, &ldquo;Why Frogs Jump
 Sideways,&rdquo; then started off with, &ldquo;When it rains...&rdquo; but got no further. Finally he said,
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; bowed, and went back to his seat.
 Totto-chan&rsquo;s turn hadn&rsquo;t come yet, but she decided that when it did she would tell her
 favorite story, &ldquo;The Prince and the Princess.&rdquo; Everyone knew it, and whenever she
 wanted to tell it during breaks, the children would say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tired of that one.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 But all the same, she decided, that was the story she was going to tell.
 The new scheme was beginning to work rather well when, one day, the child whose
 tun it was to give a talk firmly refused.
 &ldquo;I have nothing to say,&rdquo; the boy declared.
 Totto-chan was amazed to think that anyone could possibly have nothing to say. But
 that boy just didn&rsquo;t.
