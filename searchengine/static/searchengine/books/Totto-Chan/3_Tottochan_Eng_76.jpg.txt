Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t know the song. They didn&rsquo;t teach that sort of song at Tomoe. She
 sat on the edge of the bed of a man with a kind face who was sitting up, and just
 listened to them singing, feeling rather awkward. When that song was over, the
 teacher announced very clearly, &ldquo;Now we shall sing The Doll Festival.&rsquo; &rdquo; They sang
 it beautifully. All except Totto-chan.
 Came let us light the lanterns,
 Light them one by one...
 There was nothing Totto-chan could do but remain silent.
 When they had all finished singing, the men clapped. The teacher smiled and said,
 &ldquo;Now then, what about &rsquo;The pony and the Mare&rsquo;! All together. Three, four,&rdquo; and
 started beating time again.
 Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t know that one either. When the children had finished singing it, the
 soldier in the bed Totto-chan was sitting on paned her head and said, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
sing".
 Totto-chan felt very apologetic. She had come to visit the soldiers and she couldn&rsquo;t
 even sing them a single song. So she got up, and, standing a little away from the bed,
 said bravely, &ldquo;All right. Now I&rsquo;ll sing one I know.
 Something was about to happen that wasn&rsquo;t according to plan.
 &ldquo;What are you going to sing!&rdquo; asked the teacher.
 But Totto-chan had already taken a deep breath and was starting to sing, so she
 decided to wait.
 Since she was representing Tomoe, Totto-chan thought she had better sing Tomoe&rsquo;s
 best-known song. After taking that deep breath, she began:
 Chew, chew, chew it well,
 Everything you eat...
 Some of the children laughed. Others asked their neighbors, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the song!
 What&rsquo;s the song!&rdquo; The teacher started to beat time, but nor knowing quite what to do,
 was left with arms in midair. Totto-chan was embarrassed, but she sang for all she
 was worth:
 Chew it and chew it and chew it and chew it,
 Your rice and fish and meat!
 When she finished singing, Totto-chan bowed. When she raised her head, she was
 astonished to see tears streaming down the face of the soldier. She thought she must
 have done something bad. And then the soldier, who looked a little older than Daddy,
 patted her head again, and said, &ldquo;Thank you! Thank you!&rdquo;
