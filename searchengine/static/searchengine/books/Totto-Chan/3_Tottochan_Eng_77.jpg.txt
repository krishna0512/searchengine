He went on patting her head, and he couldn&rsquo;t stop crying. Then the teacher said
 brightly, as if to try and cheer him up, &ldquo;Now I think it&rsquo;s time to read out the
 compositions we&rsquo;ve written for the soldiers.&rdquo;
 The children took turns reading their compositions aloud. Totto-chan looked at her
 soldier. His nose and eyes were led, but he smiled. Totto-chan smiled back. And she
 thought to herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad the soldier smiled!&rdquo;
 What had brought tears to that soldier&rsquo;s eyes, only the soldier knew. Maybe he had a
 little girl like Totto-chan. Or maybe he was simply touched by the sweet way she
 sang that song as best she could. Or maybe because of his experience at the war
 front, he knew how near they all were to starvation, and the thought of this little girl
 singing &ldquo;Chew it well&rdquo; when there might soon be nothing left to chew may have
 filled him with sadness. The soldier may also have realized what terrible events
 would soon engulf these very children.
 The children, reading their compositions, may not have sensed it then, but the Pacific
 War was already well underway.
Health Bark
 Showing her train pass on the cord around her neck to the man at the gate--whom she
 now knew quite well-Totto-chan walked out of the station at Jiyugaoka.
 Something very interesting was going on. A young man was sitting cross-legged on a
 mat behind an enormous pile of what looked like pieces of tree bark. Five or six
 people stood around looking down at him. Totto-chan decided to join them, since the
 man was saying, &ldquo;Now watch me carefully, watch me carefully. When the man saw
 Totto-chan stop, he said, &ldquo;The most important thing for you is health. When you get
 up in the morning and want to know whether you are well or not, this piece of balk
 will tell you. Ever, morning all you have to do is chew a bit of this bark. If it tastes
 bitter, it proves you are not well. If it doesn&rsquo;t taste bitter, you know you&rsquo;re all right.
 You&rsquo;re not ill. This bark that tells you whether you&rsquo;re ill or not only costs twenty sen!
Will that gentleman over there care to try a piece!&rdquo;
 He handed the bark to a rather thin man, who timidly bit it with his front teeth. The
 man tilted his head slightly and considered it.
 &ldquo;It does seem... a tiny bit... uh.., bitter.&rdquo;
 The young man leaped up, exclaiming, &ldquo;Sir, you must be suffering from some
 disease. You&rsquo;ll have to be careful. But don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s not very serious yet. You said
 it just seemed a little bitter. Now what about the lady over there. Would you mind
 chewing this, please!&rdquo; A woman with a shopping basket took a larger piece of bark
 and chewed it vigorously. She announced cheerfully, &ldquo;Why, that wasn&rsquo;t bitter at all!&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Congratulations, madam,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;You must be very healthy, indeed.&rdquo; Then
 he said, raising his voice, &lsquo;&ldquo;Only twenty sen! Twenty sen! That&rsquo;s all it costs to find
 out every morning whether you are healthy or not. A real bargain!&rdquo;
 Totto-chan wanted to try a bite of the grayish bark, too, but was too shy to ask.
 Instead, she asked, &ldquo;Will you still be here when school&rsquo;s over?&rdquo;
