The headmaster went over to the boy&rsquo;s desk with its empty lunchbox.
 &ldquo;So you have nothing to say,&rdquo; he said.
 &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
 The boy wasn&rsquo;t trying to be clever, or anything like that. He honestly couldn&rsquo;t think
 of anything to talk about.
 The headmaster threw back his head and laughed, heedless of the gaps in his teeth.
 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try and find you something to say.
 &ldquo;Find me something?&rdquo; The boy seemed startled.
 The headmaster got the boy to stand in the center of the ring while he sat down at the
 boy&rsquo;s desk.
 &ldquo;Try and remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what you did this morning after you got up and before
 you came to school. What did you do first!&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the boy and then just scratched his head.
 &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said the headmaster, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said, &lsquo;Well.&rsquo; You did have something to say.
 What did you do after &rsquo;well?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Well,... uh...I got up,&rdquo; he said, scratching his head some more.
 Totto-chan and the others were amused, but listened attentively. The boy went on,
 &ldquo;Then, uh...&rdquo; He scratched his head again. The head-master sat patiently watching the
 boy, with a smile on his face and his hands clasped on the desk. Then he said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
 splendid. That will do. You got up this morning. You&rsquo;ve made everyone understand
 that. You don&rsquo;t have to be amusing or make people laugh to be a good speaker. The
 important thing is that you said you hadn&rsquo;t anything to talk about and you did find
 something to say.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 But the boy didn&rsquo;t sit down. He said in a very loud voice, &ldquo;And then... uh...
 All the children leaned forward. The boy took a deep breath and went on, &ldquo;And
 then.. uh... Mother...uh...she said, &rsquo;Brush your teeth&rsquo;... uh...so I brushed my teeth.&rdquo;
 The headmaster clapped. Everyone else clapped, too. Whereupon the boy, in an even
 louder voice than before, went on again, &ldquo;And then... uh...&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The children stopped clapping and listened with bated breath, leaning forward even
more.
 Finally, the boy said, triumphantly, &ldquo;And then...uh...I came to school.&rdquo;
 One of the older boys leaned forward so far he lost his balance and hit his face on his
 lunchbox. But everyone was terribly pleased that the boy had found something to
 talk about.
