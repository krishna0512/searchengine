&ldquo;What else does she do?&rdquo; asked Mother, with a sinking feeling.
 &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; exclaimed the teacher. &lsquo;&ldquo;If I could even count the things she does I
 wouldn&rsquo;t be asking you to take her away.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The teacher composed herself a little, and looked straight at Mother. &ldquo;Yesterday,
 Totto-chan was standing at the window as usual, and I went on with the lesson
 thinking she was just waiting for the street musicians, when she suddenly called out
 to somebody, &lsquo;What are you doing!&rsquo; From where I was I couldn&rsquo;t see who she was
 taking to, and I wondered what was going on. Then she called out again, &lsquo;What are
 you doing!&rsquo; She wasn&rsquo;t addressing anyone in the road but somebody high up
 somewhere. I couldn&rsquo;t help being curious, and tried to hear the reply, but there wasn&rsquo;t
 any. In spite of that, your daughter kept on calling out, What are you doing?&rsquo; so often
 I couldn&rsquo;t teach, so I went over to the window to see who your daughter was talking
 to. When I put my head out of the window and looked up, I saw it was a pair of
 swallows making a nest under the classroom eaves. She was talking to the swallows!
 Now, I understand children, and so I&rsquo;m not saying that talking to swallows is
 nonsense. It is just that I feel it is quite unnecessary to ask swallows what they are
 doing in the middle of class.&rdquo;
 Before Mother could open her mouth to apologize, the teacher went on, &lsquo;&ldquo;Then there
 was the drawing class episode. I asked the children to draw the Japanese flag, and all
 the others drew it correctly but your daughter started drawing the navy flag - you
 know the one with the rays. Nothing wrong with that, I thought. But then she
 suddenly started to draw a fringe all around it. A fringe! You know, like those fringes
 on youth group banners. She&rsquo;s probably seen one somewhere. But before I realized
 what she was doing, she had drawn a yellow fringe that went right off the edge of the
 paper and onto her desk. You see, her flag took up most of the paper, so there wasn&rsquo;t
 enough room for the fringe. She took her yellow crayon and all around her flag she
 made hundreds of strokes that extended beyond the paper, so that when she lifted up
 the paper her desk was a mass of dreadful yellow marks that wouldn&rsquo;t come off no
 matter how hard we rubbed. Fortunately, the lines were only on-three sides.&rdquo;
 Puzzled, Mother asked quickly, &ldquo;What do you mean, only three sides!&rdquo;
 Although she seemed to be getting tired, the teacher was kind enough to explain.
 &ldquo;She drew a flagpole on the left, so the fringe was only on three sides of the flag.&rdquo;
 Mother felt somewhat relieved. &ldquo;I see, only on three sides.&rdquo;
 Whereupon the teacher said very slowly, emphasizing each word, &ldquo;But most of the
 flagpole went off the paper, too, and is still on the desk as well.&rdquo;
 Then the teacher got up and said coldly, as a sort of parting shot, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the only
 one who is upset. The teacher in the classroom next door has also had trouble.&rdquo;
 Mother obviously had to do something about it. It wasn&rsquo;t fair to the other pupils.
 She&rsquo;d have to find another school, a school where they would understand her little
 girl and teach her how to get along with other people.
