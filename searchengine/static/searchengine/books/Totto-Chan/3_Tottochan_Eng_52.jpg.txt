Don&rsquo;t you surrender!
 Here&rsquo;s Issa by you.
 Fledgling Sparrows!
 Make way, make way,
 Way for the noble Horse!
 Spare the Fly!
 Wringing his hands, wringing his feet,
 He implores your mercy!
 The headmaster once improvised a melody for
 one, and they all sang it.
 Come and play with me Little Orphan
 Sparrows for mother less ye be.
 The headmaster often held haiku classes, although hey were not a formal part of the
 curriculum.
 Totto-chan&rsquo;s first effort at composing haiku described her favorite comic-strip
 character Norakuro, stray black dog who had joined the army as a private and
 gradually earned promotion in spite of he ups and downs in his career. It ran in a
 popular boy&rsquo;s magazine.
 Stray dog Black sets off
 For the Continent, now that
 He has been demobilized.
 The headmaster had said &ldquo;Try making up an honest, straight forward haiku about
 something that is in your thoughts.&rdquo;
 You couldn&rsquo;t call Totto-chan&rsquo;s a proper haiku. But it did show what sort of thing
 impressed her in those days. Her haiku didn&rsquo;t quite conform to the proper 5-7-5
 syllable form. Hers was 5-7-7.But then, Issa&rsquo;s one about the fledgling sparrows in
 Japanese was
 5-8-7, so Totto-chan thought it would be all right.
 During their walks to Kuhonbutsu Temple, or when it rained and they couldn&rsquo;t play
 outdoors but gathered in the Assembly Hall, Tomoe&rsquo;s Issa Kobayashi would tell the
 children about haiku. He also used haiku to illustrate his own thoughts about life
 and nature.
