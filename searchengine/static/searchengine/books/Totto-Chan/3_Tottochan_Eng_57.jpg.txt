The tenement was right beside the Oimachi train necks on a small embankment.
 Totto-chan knew who Masao-chan was. He was a little bigger than she was and
 probably in second grade, although she didn&rsquo;t know which school he went to. He had
 untidy hair and always had a dog with him. One day, as Totto-chan was walking
 home post the embankment, Masao-chan was standing on top of it with his feet apart
 and his hands on his hips, in an arrogant posture.
 &lsquo;&lsquo;Korean!&rdquo; he shouted at Totto-chan.
 His voice was scathing and full of hatred. Totto-chan was scared. She had never done
 anything mean to him, or even spoken to him for that matter, so she was startled
 when he yelled at her from above in such a spiteful way.
 When she got home she told Mother about it. &ldquo;Masao-chan called me a Korean,&rdquo; she
 said. Mother put her hand to her mouth and Totto-chan saw her eyes fill with mars.
 Totto-chan was perplexed, thinking it must be something very bad. Mother didn&rsquo;t
 stop to wipe away her tears, and the tip of her nose was red. &ldquo;poor child!&rdquo; she said.
 &ldquo;People must call him &rsquo;Korean! Korean!&rsquo; so ofmn that he thinks it&rsquo;s a nasty word. He
 probably doesn&rsquo;t understand what it means because he&rsquo;s still young. He thinks it&rsquo;s like
 baka, which people say when they mean &rsquo;you fool.&rsquo; Masao-chan has probably had
 &lsquo;Korean&rsquo; said to him so often he wanted to say something nasty to somebody else, so
 he called you a Korean. Why are people so cruel?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 Drying her eye, Mother said to Totto-chan very slowly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Japanese and Masao-
 chan comes from a country called Korea. But he&rsquo;s a child, just like you. So, Totto-
 chan dear, don&rsquo;t ever think of people as different. Don&rsquo;t think, That person&rsquo;s a
 Japanese, or this person&rsquo;s a Korean.&rsquo; Be nice to Masao-chan. It&rsquo;s so sad that some
 people think other people aren&rsquo;t nice just because they&rsquo;re Koreans.&rdquo;
 It was all rather difficult for Totto-chan to understand, hut what she did understand
 was that Masao-chan was a little boy whom people spoke ill of for no reason at all.
 That must be why his mother was always searching for him so anxiously, she
 thought. So next morning, as she passed the embankment and heard his mother
 calling out, &ldquo;MaSOW-chaan&rdquo; in her shrill voice, she wondered where he could be,
 and made up her mind that even though she herself wasn&rsquo;t a Korean, if Masao-chan
 called her that again, she would reply, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all children! We&rsquo;re all the same,&rdquo; and
 she&rsquo;d try to make friends with him.
 Masao-chan&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s voice, with its combination of irritation and anxiety, had a
 special quality of its own that seemed to linger in the air for a long time, until it was
 drowned by the sound of a passing train.
 &lsquo;&lsquo;MaSOW-chaan!&rdquo;
 Once you heard the sad, tearful sound of that voice you could never forget it.
 Pigtails
 About that time, Totto-chan had two great ambitions. One was to wear athletic
 bloomers, and the other was to braid her hair. Watching older school-girls with long
 braids in the train, she decided she wanted to wear her hair that way, too. While the
