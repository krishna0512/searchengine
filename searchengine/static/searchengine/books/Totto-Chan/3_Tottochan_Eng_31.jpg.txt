Yasuaki-chan leaned against the trunk smiling rather bashfully. He said, &ldquo;May I
 come in?&rdquo;
 Yasuaki-chan was able to see vistas he had never glimpsed before. &ldquo;So this is what
 it&rsquo;s like to climb a tree,&rdquo; he said happily.
 They stayed on the tree for a long time and talked about all sorts of things.
 &ldquo;My sister in America says they&rsquo;ve got something there called television,&rdquo; said
 Yasuaki-chan with enthusiasm. &ldquo;She says that when it comes to Japan we&rsquo;ll be able
 to sit at home and watch sumo wrestling. She says it&rsquo;s like a box.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan didn&rsquo;t understand yet how much it would mean to Yasuaki-chan, who
 couldn&rsquo;t go very far afield, to be able to watch all sorts of things at home.
 She simply wondered how sumo wrestlers could get inside a box in your own house.
 Sumo wrestlers were so big! But it was fascinating all the same. In those days
 nobody knew about television. Yasuaki-chan was the first to tell Totto-chan about it.
 The cicadas were singing and the two children were so happy. And for Yasuaki-chan
 it was the first and last time he ever climbed a tree.
 The Bravery Test
 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s scary, smells bad, and tastes good?&rdquo;
 They liked this riddle so much that even though they knew the answer, Totto-chan
 and her friends never tired of saying to one another, &ldquo;Ask me the riddle about what&rsquo;s
 scary and smells bad!&rdquo;
 The answer was,&ldquo;A demon in the toilet eating a bean-jam bun!&rdquo;
 The way the Tomoe Bravery Test ended would have made a good riddle too. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
 scary, itches, and makes you laugh?&rdquo;
 The night they set up tents in the Assembly Hall and went camping, the headmaster
 announced, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to hold a Bravery Test one night at Kuhonbutsu Temple.
 Hands up if you want to be a ghost.&rdquo;
 About seven boys vied for the privilege. When the children assembled at the school
 on the appointed evening, the boys who were going to be ghosts brought costumes
 they had made themselves and went off to hide in the temple grounds.
 &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll scare you to death!&rdquo; they said as they left.
 The remaining thirty or so children divided themselves into small groups of about
 five and set off for Kuhonbutsu at staggered intervals. They were supposed to walk
 right around the temple grounds and the graveyard and then come back to the school.
 The headmaster explained that although this was a test to see how brave they were, it
 would be perfectly all right if anybody wanted to come back without finishing the
course.
