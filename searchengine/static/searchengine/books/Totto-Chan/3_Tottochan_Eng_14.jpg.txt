&ldquo;Have you something from the ocean and something from the hills?&rdquo; he asked,
 checking each ore. It was so exciting to discover what each had brought from the
 ocean and from the hills.
 Sometimes a mother had been too busy and her child had only something from the
 hills, or only something from the ocean. But never mind. As the headmaster made his
 round of inspection, his wife followed him, wearing a cook&rsquo;s white apron and holding
 a pan in each hand. If the headmaster stopped in front of a pupil saying, &ldquo;Ocean,&rdquo; she
 would dole out a couple of boiled chikuwa (fish rolls) from the &ldquo;Ocean&rdquo; saucepan,
 and if the headmaster said, &ldquo;Hills,&rdquo; out would come some chunks of soy-simmered
 potato from the &ldquo;Hills&rdquo; saucepan.
 No one would have dreamed of saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like fish rolls,&rdquo; any more than
 thinking what a fine lunch so-and-so has or what a miserable lunch poor so-and-so
 always brings. The children&rsquo;s only concern was whether they had satisfied the two
 requirements - the ocean and the hills--and if so their joy was complete and they
 were all in good spirits.
 Beginning to understand what &ldquo;something from the ocean and something from the
 hills&rdquo; was all about, Totto-chan had doubts whether the lunch her mother had so
 hastily prepared that morning would be approved. But when she opened the
 lunchbox, she found such a marvelous lunch inside, it was all she could do to stop
 herself shouting, &ldquo;Oh, goody, goody!&rdquo;
 Totto-chan&rsquo;s lunch contained bright yellow scrambled eggs, green peas, brown
 denbu, and pink naked cod roe. It was as colorful as a newer garden.
 &ldquo;How very pretty,&rdquo; said the headmaster.
 Totto-chan was thrilled. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s a very good cook,&rdquo; she said.
 &ldquo;She is, is she?&rdquo; said the headmaster. Then he pointed to the denbu. &ldquo;All right.
 What&rsquo;s this! Is it from the ocean or the hills?&rsquo;
 Totto-chan looked at it, wondering which was right. It was the color of earth, so
 maybe it was from the hills. But she couldn&rsquo;t be sure.
 &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said.
 The headmaster then addressed the whole school, &ldquo;Where does denbu come from, the
 ocean or the hills?&rdquo;
 After a pause, while they thought about it, some shouted, &ldquo;Hills,&rdquo; and others shouted,
 &ldquo;Ocean,&rdquo; but no one seemed to know for certain.
 &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the headmaster. &ldquo;Denbu is from the ocean.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked a fat boy.
 Standing in the middle of the circle of desks, the headmaster explained, &ldquo;Denbu is
 made by scraping the flesh of cooked fish off the bones, lightly roasting and crushing
 it into fine pieces, which are then dried and flavored.&rsquo;&rdquo;
