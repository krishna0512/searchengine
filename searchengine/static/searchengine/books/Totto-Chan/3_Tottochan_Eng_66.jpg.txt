After that Totto-chan stopped going to his studio. True, she liked leaping about in
 bare feet, not wearing ballet shoes, and striking poses she thought up herself. But,
 after all, she did so want to wear one of those tiny, glittering crowns!
 &ldquo;Swan Lake is nice,&rdquo; said the teacher, &ldquo;but I wish I could get you to like just dancing
 according to you fancy.
 It wasn&rsquo;t until years later that Totto-chan found out that his name was Baku Ishii and
 that he not only introduced free ballet to Japan but also gave the name Jiyugaoka
"(freedom hill&rsquo;) to the area. In addition to all that-&mdash;he was fifty at the time--this man
 tried to teach Totto-chan the joy of dancing freely.
 Te Farming Teacher
 &ldquo;This is your teacher today. He&rsquo;s going to show you all sorts of things.&rdquo; With that the
 headmaster introduced a new teacher. Totto-chan took a good look at him. In the first
 place, he wasn&rsquo;t dressed like a teacher at all. He wore a short striped cotton work
 jacket over his undershirt, and instead of a necktie, he had a towel hanging around
 his neck. As for his trousers, they were of indigo-dyed cotton with narrow legs, and
 were full of patches. Instead of shoes, he wore workmen&rsquo;s thick two-toed, rubber-
 soled socks, while on his head was a rather dilapidated straw hat.
 The children were all assembled by the, pond at Kuhonbutsu Temple.
 As she stared at the teacher, Totto-chan thought she had seen him before. &ldquo;Where!&rdquo;
 she wondered. His kindly face was sun burnt and full of wrinkles. Even the slender
 pipe dangling from a black cord around his waist that served as a belt looked
 familiar. She suddenly remembered!
 &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the farmer who works in the field by the stream!&rdquo; she asked him,
 delighted.
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;teacher, with a toothy smile, wrinkling up his face. &ldquo;You pass
 my place ev&rsquo;ry time you go fer yer walks to Kuhonbutsu! That&rsquo;s my field. That one
 over there full o&rsquo; mustard blossoms.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Wow! So you&rsquo;re going to be our teacher today, cried the children excitedly.
 &ldquo;Naw!&rdquo; said the man, waving his hand in front of his face. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no teacher! I&rsquo;m just
 a farmer. Your headmaster just asked me to do it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Oh yes, he is. He&rsquo;s your farming teacher,&rdquo; said the headmaster, standing beside him.
 &ldquo;He very kindly agreed to teach you how to plant a field. It&rsquo;s like having a baker
 teach you how to make bread. Now then,&rdquo; he said to the farmer, &ldquo;tell the children
 what to do, and let&rsquo;s get started.&rdquo;
 At an ordinary elementary school, anyone who taught the children anything would
 probably have to have teaching qualifications, bur Mr. Kobayashi didn&rsquo;t worry about
 things like that. He thought it important for children to learn by actually seeing things
 done.
