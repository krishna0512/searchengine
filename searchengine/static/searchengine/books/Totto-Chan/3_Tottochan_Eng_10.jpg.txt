A moment later Mother was startled to see Totto-chan remove the train pass and
 hang it around Rocky&rsquo;s neck instead. &ldquo;Oh dear...&rdquo; thought Mother, but she decided
 to say nothing but wait and see what happened.
 After Totto-chan put the cord with the pass around Rocky&rsquo;s neck, she squatted down
 and said to him, &ldquo;You see? This pass doesn&rsquo;t fit you at all.&rdquo;
 The cord was much too long and the pass dragged on the ground.
 &ldquo;Do you understand? This is my pass, not yours. You won&rsquo;t be able to get on the
 train. I&rsquo;ll ask the headmaster, though, and the man at the station, and see if they&rsquo;ll let
 you come to school, too.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Rocky listened attentively at first, ears pointed, but after giving the pass a few licks,
 he yawned. Totto-chan went on, &ldquo;The classroom train doesn&rsquo;t move, so I don&rsquo;t think
 you&rsquo;ll need a ticket to get on that one, but today you&rsquo;ll just have to stay home and
 wait for me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Rocky always used to walk with Totto-chan as far as the gate of the other school and
 then come back home. Naturally, he was expecting to do the same today.
 Totto-chan took the cord with the pass off Rocky&rsquo;s neck and carefully hung it around
 her own. She called out once more to Mother and Daddy, &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;
 Then she ran off, without a backward glance, her bag flapping against her back.
 Rocky bounded along happily beside her.
 The way to the station was almost the same as to the old school, so Totto-chan
 passed dogs and cats she knew, as well as children from her former class.
 Should she show them her pass and impress them, Totto-chan wondered? But she
 didn&rsquo;t want to be late, so she decided not to that day, and hurried on.
 When Totto-chan turned right at the station instead of left as usual, poor Rocky
 stopped and looked around anxiously. Totto-chan was already at the ticket gate, but
 she went back to Rocky, who stood, looking mystified.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to the other school any more. I&rsquo;m going to a new one now.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Totto-chan put her face against Rocky&rsquo;s. His ears were smelly, as usual, but to Totto-
 chan it was a nice smell.
 &ldquo;Bye-bye,&rdquo; she said and, showing the man her pass, she started climbing up the steep
 station stairs. Rocky whimpered softly and watched until Totto-chan was out of
 sight.
 The Classroom in the Tin
 No one had arrived yet when Totto-chan got to the door of the railroad car the
 headmaster had told her would be her classroom. It was an old-fashioned car, one
 that still had a door handle on the outside. You took hold of the handle with both
