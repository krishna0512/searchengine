&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Mother.&ldquo;I would refuse. We&rsquo;ll get food somehow.&rdquo;
 Daddy knew Totto-chan had barely enough to eat and was vainly putting money in
 the caramel vending machine every day. He also knew that the gifts of food he would
 receive for playing a few wartime tunes would be very handy for his family. But
 Daddy valued his music even more. Mother knew that, too, and so she never urged
 him to do it. &ldquo;Forgive me, Totsky!&rdquo; said Daddy, sadly.
 Totto-chan was too young to know about art and ideology and work. But she did
 know that Daddy loved the violin so much he had been something called &ldquo;disowned,&rdquo;
 and many of his family and relatives did not speak to him any more. He had had a
 hard time, but he had refused to give up the violin all the same. So Totto-chan
 thought it quite right for him not to play something he didn&rsquo;t like. Totto-chan skipped
 about around Daddy and said cheerfully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. Because I love your violin,
 too.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 But the next day Totto-chan again got off at Ookayama and peered into the hole in
 the vending machine. It was unlikely that anything would come out, but she still kept
 hoping.
 The Promise
 After lunch, when the children put away the chairs and desks that had been arranged
 in a circle, the Assembly Hall seemed quite spacious.
 &ldquo;Today, I&rsquo;m going to be the first to climb on the headmaster&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; decided Totto-
 chan.
 That&rsquo;s what she always wanted to do, but if she hesitated for a moment, someone else
 would have already climbed into his lap as he sat cross-legged in the middle of the
 Assembly Hall, and at least two others would be scrambling onto his back, clamoring
 for his attention.
 &ldquo;Hey, stop it, stop it,&rdquo; the headmaster would remonstrate, red in the face with
 laughter, but once they had occupied his back, the children were determined not to
 give up their position. So if you were the least bit slow, you&rsquo;d find the headmaster&rsquo;s
 back very crowded. But this time Totto-chan made up her mind to be there first and
 was already waiting in the middle of the Assembly Hall when the headmaster
 arrived. As he approached, she shouted to him, &ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;ve got something to tell you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo; asked the headmaster delightedly, as he sat down on the floor and
 started to cross his legs.
 Totto-chan wanted to tell him what she had decided after several days&rsquo; thought.
 When the headmaster had crossed his legs, Totto-chan suddenly decided against
 climbing on his back. What she had to say would be more appropriate said face to
 face. So she sat down very close to him, facing him, and tilted her head a little with a
 smile that Mother had called her 'nice face&rsquo;&rdquo; ever since she was small. It was her
 &ldquo;Sunday best&rdquo; face. She felt confident when she smiled like that, her mouth slightly
 open, and she herself believed she was a good girl.
