unconscious. The picture that had looked so entertaining showed him flying through
 the room. Afterward, that book was always in great demand.
 All the students of the school, packed into the train like sardines, devouring the
 books so eagerly in the morning sunlight that was pouring through the windows,
 must have presented a sight that gladdened the heart of the headmaster.
 The children spent the whole of that day in the library car.
 After that, when they couldn&rsquo;t be outdoors because of rain, and at many other times,
 the library became a favorite gathering place for them.
 &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better have a bathroom built neat the library,&rdquo; said the headmaster one
 day.
 That was because the children would become so absorbed in their books that they
 were always holding out until the very last minute before making a dash for the toilet
 beyond the Assembly Hall, holding themselves in strange contortions.
 Tails
 One afternoon, when school was over and Totto-chan was preparing to go home, Oe
 came running to her and whispered, &ldquo;The headmaster&rsquo;s mad at somebody.&rdquo;.
 &lsquo;&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; asked Totto-chan.
 She had never heard of the headmaster getting angry and was amazed. Oe was
 obviously amazed, too, the way he had come running in such a hurry to tell her.
 &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the kitchen,&rdquo; said Oe, his good-natured eyes opened wide and his nostrils
 a little dilated.
 &lsquo;Come on!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Totto-chan took Oe&rsquo;s hand and they both raced toward the headmaster&rsquo;s house. It
 adjoined the Assembly Hall, and the kitchen was right by the back entrance to the
 school grounds. The time Totto-chan fell into the cesspool she was taken through the
 kitchen to the bathroom to be scrubbed clean. And it was in the headmaster&rsquo;s kitchen
 that &ldquo;something from the ocean and something from the hills&rdquo; were made to be doled
 out at lunchtime.
 As the two children tiptoed toward the kitchen, they heard the angry voice of the
 headmaster through the closed door.
 &ldquo;What made you say so thoughtlessly to Takahashi that he had a tail?&rdquo;
 It was their homeroom teacher who was being reprimanded.
 &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it seriously,&rdquo; they heard her reply.
 &ldquo;I just happened to notice him at that moment, and he looked so cute.&rdquo;
