join up their drawings just for fun and the whole floor would become one enormous
 picture.
 At intervals during the music class, the headmaster would come over and inspect
 each child&rsquo;s rhythms. He would comment, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; or &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t a flag-flag
 there, it was a skip.&rdquo;
 After he had approved or corrected their notation, he played the music over again so
 they could check what they had done and familiarize themselves with the rhythms.
 No matter how busy he was, the head-master never let anyone else take these classes
 for him. And as far as the children were concerned, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been any fun at
 all without Mr. Kobayashi.
 Cleaning up after writing rhythms was quite a job. First you had to wipe the floor
 with a blackboard eraser, and then everyone joined forces to make the floor spick and
 span again with mops and rags. It was an enormous task.
 In this way Tomoe children learned what trouble cleaning off graffiti could be, so
 they never scribbled anywhere except on the floor of the Assembly Hall. Moreover,
 this class took place about twice a week, so the children had their fill of scribbling.
 The children at Tomoe became real experts on chalk&mdash;which kind was best, how to
 hold it, how to manipulate it for the best results, how not to break it. Every one of
 them was a chalk connoisseur.
 &lsquo;Yasuaki chan&rsquo;s Dead&rsquo;&rsquo;
 It was the first morning of school after the spring vacation. Mr. Kobayashi stood in
 front of the children assembled on the school grounds, his hands in his pockets as
 usual. But he didn&rsquo;t say anything for some time. Then he took his hands out of his
 pockets and looked at the children. He looked as if he had been crying.
 &ldquo;Yasuaki-chan&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to his funeral today.&rdquo; Then
 he went on, &ldquo;You all liked Yasuaki-chan, I know. It&rsquo;s a great shame. I feel terribly
 sad.&rdquo; He only got that far when his face became bright red and tears welled up in his
 eyes. The children were stunned and nobody said a word. They were all thinking
 about Yasuaki-chan. Never had such a sad quietness passed over the grounds of
 Tomoe before.
 &ldquo;Imagine dying so soon,&rdquo; thought Totto-chan.&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even finished Uncle Tom&rsquo;s
 Cabin that Yasuaki-chan said I ought to read and lent me before the vacation.&rdquo;
 She remembered how crooked his fingers had looked when she and Yasuaki-chan
 said goodbye before spring vacation and he handed her the book. She recalled the
 first time she met him, when she had asked, &ldquo;Why do you walk like that?&rdquo; and his
 soft reply, &ldquo;I had polio&rdquo; She thought of the sound of his voice and his little smile.
 And that summer tree-climbing adventure of just the two of them. She remembered
 with nostalgia how heavy his body had been, and the way he had trusted her
 implicitly even though he was older and taller. It was Yasuaki-chan who told her
 they had something in America called television. Totto-chan loved Yasuaki-chan.
 They had lunch together, spent their breaks together, and walked to the station
