There were already six cars lined up together as classrooms, but one more was
 coming. Miyo-chan said it was going to be a library car. They were all terribly
 excited.
 &ldquo;I wonder what route it will take to get to the school,&rdquo; someone said.
 It was a challenging topic. There was a momentary hush.
 &ldquo;Maybe it will come along the Oimachi Line tracks and then branch off this way at
 that level crossing,&rdquo; someone suggested.
 &ldquo;Then it would have to derail,&rsquo;&rdquo; said someone else.
 &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll just bring it on a cart,&rdquo; said another.
 &ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be a cart big enough to hold one of those cars,&rdquo; someone pointed out
 immediately.
 &lsquo;&lsquo;I suppose not...&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Ideas petered out. The children realized a railroad car certainly wouldn&rsquo;t fit on a cart
 or even a truck.
 &ldquo;Rails!&rdquo; said Totto-chan after much thought.
 &ldquo;You know, they&rsquo;re probably going to lay some rails right here to the school!&rdquo;
 &ldquo;From where?&rsquo; asked someone.
 &ldquo;Where? From wherever the train is now,&rdquo; said Totto-chan, beginning to think her
 idea wasn&rsquo;t such a good one, after all. She had no idea where the car was coming
 from, and, anyway, they wouldn&rsquo;t pull down houses and things in order to lay tracks
 in a straight line to the school.
 After much fruitless discussion of one possibility after another, the children finally
 decided not to go home that afternoon but to wait and see the car arrive. Miyo-chan
 was elected to go and ask her father, the headmaster, if they could all remain at
 school until that night. It was some while before she came back.
 &ldquo;The car is arriving terribly late tonight,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;after all the other trains have
 stopped running. Anybody who really wants to see it will have to go home first and
 ask permission. Then they can come back if they like with their pajamas and a
 blanket after they&rsquo;ve had their dinner.
 &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; The children were more excited than ever.
 &ldquo;He said to bring our pajamas?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;And blankets?&rsquo;
