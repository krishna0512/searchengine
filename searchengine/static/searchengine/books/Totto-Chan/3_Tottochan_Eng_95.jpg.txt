&ldquo;What kind of school shall we build next?&rdquo; he asked his university-student son
 Tomoe, who stood beside him. Tomoe listened to him dumbfounded.
 Mr. Kobayashi&rsquo;s love for children and his passion for teaching were stronger than the
 flames now enveloping the school. The headmaster was cheerful.
 Totto-chan was lying down in a crowded evacuation train, squeezed in amongst
 adults. The train was headed northeast. As she looked out of the window at the
 darkness outside, she thought of the headmaster&rsquo;s parting words, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again!&rdquo;
 and the words he used to say to her time and time again, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really a good girl,
 you know.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t want to forget those words. Safe in the thought that soon she
 would see Mr. Kobayashi again, she fell asleep.
 The train rumbled along in the darkness with its load of anxious passengers.
