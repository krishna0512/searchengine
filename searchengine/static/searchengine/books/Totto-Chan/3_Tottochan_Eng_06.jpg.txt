Startled, Mother began to run after her. Mother had been on a basketball team once,
 so she was faster than Totto-chan and caught hold of her dress just as she reached a
 door.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go in yet,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mother, holding her back. &lsquo;&ldquo;The cars are classrooms, and
 you haven&rsquo;t even been accepted here yet. If you really want to get on this train, you&rsquo;ll
 have to be nice and polite to the headmaster. We&rsquo;re going to call on him now, and if
 all goes well, you&rsquo;ll be able to go to this school. Do you understand?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Totto-chan was awfully disappointed not to get on the &ldquo;train&rdquo; right away, but she
 decided she had better do as Mother told her.
 &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said. And then added, &ldquo;I like this school a lot.&rdquo;
 Mother felt like telling her it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of whether she liked the school but of
 whether the headmaster liked her. But she just let go of Totto-chan&rsquo;s dress, took hold
 of her hand, and started walking toward the headmaster&rsquo;s office.
 All the railroad cars were quiet, for the first classes of the day had begun. Instead of a
 wall, the not very spacious school grounds were surrounded by trees, and there were
 flower beds full of red and yellow flowers.
 The headmaster&rsquo;s office wasn&rsquo;t in a railroad car, but was on the right-hand side of a
 one-story building that stood at the top of a semicircular flight of about seven stone
 steps opposite the gate.
 Totto-chan let go of Mother&rsquo;s hand and raced up the steps, then turned around
 abruptly, almost causing Mother to run into her.
 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Mother asked, fearing Totto-chan might have changed her mind
 about the school.
 Standing above her on the top step, Totto-chan whispered to Mother in all
 seriousness, &ldquo;The man we&rsquo;re going to see must be a stationmaster!&rdquo;
 Mother had plenty of patience as well as a great sense of fun. She put her face close
 to Totto-chan&rsquo;s and whispered, &lsquo;&ldquo;Why?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 Totto-chan whispered back, &ldquo;You said he was the headmaster, but if he owns all
 these trains, he must be a stationmaster.&rdquo;
 Mother had to admit it was unusual for a school to make use of old railroad cars, but
 there was no time to explain. She simply said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask him yourself!
 And, anyway, what about Daddy? He plays the violin and owns several violins, but
 that doesn&rsquo;t make our house a violin shop, does it?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Totto-chan agreed, catching hold of Mother&rsquo;s hand.
 The Headmaster
 When Mother and Totto-chan went in, the man in the office got up from his chair.
