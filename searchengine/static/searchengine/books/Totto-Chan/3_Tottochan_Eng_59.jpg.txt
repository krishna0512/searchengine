&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; she asked, rather shyly, raising her tear-stained face.
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrific!&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.
 Totto-chan stopped crying, and got down from her chair saying, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t cry any
 more even if Oe says &rsquo;Heave-ho.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The headmaster nodded approval with a grin.
 Totto-chan smiled, too. Her smiling face suited her pigtails. Bowing to the
 headmaster, she ran back and began playing with the other children.
 She had almost forgotten about having cried when she saw Oe standing in front of
 her, scratching his head.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I pulled them,&rdquo; he said in a loud, flat voice.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been scolded by the
 headmaster. He said you&rsquo;ve got to be nice to girls. He said to be gentle with girls and
 look after them.&rdquo;
 Totto-chan was somewhat amazed. She had never heard anyone before say you had
 to be nice to girls. Boys were always the important ones. In the families she knew
 where there were lots of children,-it was always the boys who were served first at
 meals and at snack time, and when girls spoke, their mothers would say, &ldquo;Little girls
 should be seen and not heard.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 In spite of all that, the headmaster had told Oe that girls should be looked after. It
 seemed strange to Totto-chan. And then she thought how nice that was. It was nice to
 be looked after.
 As for Oe, it was a shock. Fancy being told to be gentle and nice to girls! VMoreover,
 it was the first and last time at Tomoe that he was ever scolded by the headmaster,
 and he never forgot that day.
"Thank You&rsquo;&rsquo;
 New Year&rsquo;s vacation drew near. Unlike summer vacation, the children didn&rsquo;t gather
 at school at all but spent the whole time with their families.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to spend New Year&rsquo;s with my grandfather in Kyushu,&rdquo; Migita kept telling
 everyone, while Tai-chan, who liked doing science experiments, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
 with my older brother to visit a physics laboratory.&rdquo; He was looking forward to it.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;ll be seeing you,&rdquo; each said, telling one another their plans as they parted
 Company.
 Totto-chan went skiing with Daddy and Mother. Daddy&rsquo;s friend Hideo Saito, the
 cellist and conductor in the same orchestra, had a beautiful house in the Shiga
 Highlands. They used to stay with him there every winter, and Totto-chan had started
 learning how to ski from the time she was in kindergarten.
 You took a horse-drawn sleigh from the station to the skiing area--a pure white
 snowscape, unbroken by ski lifts or anything but the stumps of trees here and there.
