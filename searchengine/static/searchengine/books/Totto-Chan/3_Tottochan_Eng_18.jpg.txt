The School Song
 Each day at Tomoe Gakuen was filled with surprises for Totto-chan. So eager was
 she to go to school that mornings never dawned soon enough. And when she got
 home she couldn&rsquo;t stop talking&mdash;telling Rocky and Mother and Daddy all about what
 she had done at school that day and what fun it had been, and all the surprises.
Mother would finally have to say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, dear. Stop talking and have your
 afternoon snack.&rdquo;
 Even when Totto-chan was quite accustomed to the new school, she still had
 mountains of things to talk about every day. And Mother rejoiced to think that this
was so.
 One day, on her way to school in the train, Totto-chan suddenly began wondering
 whether Tomoe had a school song. Wanting to find out as soon as possible, she could
 hardly wait to get there. Although there were still two more stations to go, she went
 and stood by the door, ready to jump out as soon as the train pulled into Jiyugaoka. A
 lady getting on at the station before saw the little girl at the door and naturally
 thought she was getting off. when the child remained motionless--poised like a
 runner, all set and &ldquo;on your marks&rdquo;- the lady muttered, &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s the matter
 with her.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 When the train arrived at the station, Totto-chan was off it in a flash. By the time the
 young conductor was calling out, &ldquo;Jiyugaoka! Jiyugaoka!&rsquo;&rdquo;--one foot smartly on the
 platform before the train had come to a proper halt-Totto-chan had already
 disappeared through the exit.
 The moment she was inside the railroad-car classroom, Totto-chan asked Taiji
 Yamanouchi, who was already there, &ldquo;Tai-chan, does this school have a song?&rdquo;
 Tai-chan, who liked physics, replied after some thought, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it has.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Totto-chan, pensively. &ldquo;Well, I think it ought to. We had a lovely one at
 my other school.&rdquo;
 She began singing it at the top of her voice:
 Tho&rsquo; shallow the waters of Senzoku Pond,
 Deep is our learning of vistas beyond...
 Totto-chan had only gone to the school a short time, and the words were difficult, but
 she had no trouble remembering the song. That part, at any rate.
 Tai-chan seemed impressed. By this time other pupils had arrived, and they, too,
 seemed impressed by the big words she used.
 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the headmaster to make up a school song!&rdquo; said Totto-chan.
 &ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s!&rdquo; agreed the others, and they all trooped over to the headmaster&rsquo;s office.
