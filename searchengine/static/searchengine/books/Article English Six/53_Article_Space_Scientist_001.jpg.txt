The battle for heliocentricity
There istalk of a new astrologer who wants to prove that Earth moves and goes around instead
of the sky, the Sun, the Moon.  the fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside down,
said the much reversed Martin Luther, one of the pioneers of the Protestant Reformation. He was
reacting to the equally famous sixteenth-century astronomer Nicolas Copernicus and his remarkable
theory that it was the Earth which went around the Sun and not the other way round. This theory came
to be known as heliocentricity.
Copernicus was the first astonomer to mathematically disprove the age-old geocentric belief-that
the Earth was the centre of the universe and that everything-the sun,Moon,start-went around it 
Unfortunately , Copernicus suffered the same fate as many other astronomers before him-his theory 
can into a collision course with the Vies of the Church.
The theory of heliocentricity was not new, though Copernicus is credited for having partially proven
it for the first time. The non-geocentric model was perhaps first proposed by Philolaus (390 BCE),
who said that the centre of the universe was a ball of fire, around which the Sun, Moon, the Earth and
the stars reolved.
A century later, in 270 BCE, Aristarchus of Samos, a Greek philosopher, stated that the Earth went
around the Sun in an elliptical orbit. He even calculated that the Sun was about seven times wider (in
radius) than the Earth and therefore hundreds of times more voluminous. In 499 CE, about a thousand
years before Copernicus, the Indian astronomer Aryabhatta went a step further and propounded that
the Earth rotated on its axis, besides going around the Sun. He also predicted solar and lunar eclipses
