III. Life on other planets
If there is one question that people never tire of asking space scientists, it is this-is there life outside
planet Earth? I remember a fifth-grader, a boy named Ramesh, from junpur, Uttar Pradesh, asking
once, &lsquo;Sir! when will I be able to shake hands with an alien? The answer to this question requires
some serious thinking
we all know that so far. despite numerous attempts. no scientist has been able to communicate with o
detect  life outside the Earth Of course. the problem may also lie with our communication
technologies Which by the standards needed for deep  applications  are still underdeveloped.
But a more relevant question to being with is what makes Earth so conducive to life.
We discussed this with many space  scientists life sciences experts finally. we came  with a list
of factors responsible for life on Earth They are
l. Its temperature and gravity
2. Its rocky surface
3. The presence or atmosphere 
4. The presence of water and oxygen 
5. The Presence of other greenhouse gases, iucluding carban dioxide Which keep the planet
warm 
6. The Moon, which holds the spinning Earth in its position
7. The ozone layer, which cuts off harmful radiation
