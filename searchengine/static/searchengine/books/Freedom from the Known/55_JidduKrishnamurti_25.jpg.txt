Chapter 4
We said in the last chapter that joy was something entirely different from
pleasure, so let us find out what is involved in pleasure and whether it is at all
possible to live in a world that does not contain pleasure but a tremendous sense
of joy, of bliss.
We are all engaged in the pursuit of pleasure in some form or other -
intellectual, sensuous or cultural pleasure, the pleasure of reforming, telling
others what to do, of modifying the evils of society, of doing good - the pleasure
of greater knowledge, greater physical satisfaction, greater experience, greater
understanding of life, all the clever, cunning things of the mind - and the ultimate
pleasure is, of course, to have God.
Pleasure is the structure of society. From childhood until death we are
secretly, cunningly or obviously pursuing pleasure. So whatever our form of
pleasure is, l think we should be very clear about it because it is going to guide
and shape our lives. It is therefore important for each one of us to investigate
closely, hesitantly and delicately this question of pleasure, for to find pleasure,
and then nourish and sustain it, is a basic demand of life and without it existence
becomes dull, stupid, lonely and meaningless.
You may ask why then should life not be guided by pleasure? For the very
simple reason that pleasure must bring pain, frustration, sorrow and fear, and, out
of fear, violence. If you want to live that way, live that way. Most of the world
does, anyway, but if you want to be free from sorrow you must understand the
whole structure of pleasure
To understand pleasure is not to deny it. We are not condemning it or saying it
is right or wrong, but if we pursue it, let us do so with our eyes open, knowing that
a mind that is all the time seeking pleasure must inevitably find its shadow, pain.
They cannot be separated, although we run after pleasure and try to avoid pain.
