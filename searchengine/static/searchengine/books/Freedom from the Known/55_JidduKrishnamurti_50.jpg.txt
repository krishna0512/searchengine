investigates must inevitably be fragmentary, so l can see the totality of something
only when thought does not interfere.
Then l see the fact of my dependence; l see actually what is. I see it without
any like or dislike; l do not want to get rid of that dependence or to be free from
the cause of it. l observe it, and when there is observation of this kind l see the
whole picture, not a fragment of the picture, and when the mind sees the whole
picture there is freedom. Now l have discovered that there is a dissipation of
energy when there is fragmentation. l have found the very source of the
dissipation of energy.
You may think there is no waste of energy if you imitate, if you accept
authority, if you depend on the priest, the ritual, the dogma, the party or on some
ideology, but the following and acceptance of an ideology, whether it is good or
bad, whether it is holy or unholy, is a fragmentary activity and therefore a cause
of conflict, and conflict will inevitably arise so long as there is a division between
what should be’ and what is’, and any conflict is a dissipation of energy.
f you put the question to yourself, How am l to be free from conflict?’, you are
creating another problem and hence you are increasing conflict, whereas if you
just see it as a fact - see it as you would see some concrete object - clearly,
directly - then you will understand essentially the truth of a life in which there is no
conflict at all.
Let us put it another way. We are always comparing what we are with what we
should be. The should-be is a projection of what we think we ought to be.
Contradiction exists when there is comparison, not only with something or
somebody, but with what you were yesterday, and hence there is conflict
between what has been and what is. There is what is only when there is no
comparison at all, and to live with what is, is to be peaceful. Then you can give
your whole attention without any distraction to what is within yourself - whether it
