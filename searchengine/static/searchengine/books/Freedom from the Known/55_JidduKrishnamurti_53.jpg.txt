get rid of what is’, but if never does. You may preach non-violence for the rest of
your life and all the time be sowing the seeds of violence.
You have a concept of what you should be and how you should act, and all
the time you are in fact acting quite differently, so you see that principles, beliefs
and ideals must inevitably lead to hypocrisy and a dishonest life. It is the ideal
that creates the opposite to what is, so if you know how to be with what is’, then
the opposite is not necessary.
Trying to become like somebody else, or like your ideal, is one of the main
causes of contradiction, confusion conflict. A mind that is confused, whatever it
does, at any level, will remain confused; any action born of confusion leads to
further confusion. I see this very clearly, l see it as clearly as l see an immediate
physical danger. So what happens? l cease to act in terms of confusion any
more. Therefore inaction is complete action.
