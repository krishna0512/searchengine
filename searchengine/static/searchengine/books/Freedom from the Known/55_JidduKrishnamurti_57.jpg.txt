So can you - can you and l - live with what we actually are, knowing ourselves
to be dull, envious, fearful, believing we have tremendous affection when we
have not, getting easily hurt, easily flattered and bored - can we live with all that,
either accepting it nor denying if, but just observing it without becoming morbid,
depressed or elated?
Now let us ask ourselves a further question. ls this freedom, this solitude, this
coming into contact with the whole structure of what we are in ourselves - is it to
be come upon through time? That is, is freedom to be achieved through a gradual
process? Obviously not, because as soon as you introduce time you are
enslaving yourself more and more. You cannot become free gradually. It is not a
matter of time.
The next question is, can you become conscious of that freedom? If you say, ’l
am free’, then you are not free. It is like a man saying,l am happy’. The moment
he says,’l am happy’ he is living in a memory of something that has gone.
Freedom can only come about naturally, not through wishing, wanting, longing.
Nor will you find it by creating an image of what you think it is. To come upon if
the mind has to learn to look at life, which is a vast movement, without the
bondage of time, for freedom lies beyond the field of consciousness.
