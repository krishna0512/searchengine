Chapter 8
NONE OF THE agonies of suppression, nor the brutal discipline of conforming
to a pattern has led to truth. To come upon truth the mind must be completely
free, without a spot of distortion.
But first let us ask ourselves if we really want to be free? When we talk of
freedom are we talking of complete freedom or of freedom from some
inconvenient or unpleasant or undesirable thing? We would like to be free from

another reaction which will bring about another conformity, another form of
