Chapter 9
I AM TEMPTED TO repeat a story about a great disciple going to God and
demanding to be taught truth. T his poor God says, My friend, it is such a hot day,
please get me a glass of water.’ So the disciple goes out and knocks on the door
of the first house he comes to and a beautiful young lady opens the door. The
disciple falls in love with her and they marry and have several children. Then one
day it begins to rain, and keeps on raining, raining, raining - the torrents are
swollen, the streets are full, the houses are being washed away. The disciple
holds on to his wife and carries his children on his shoulders and as he is being
swept away he calls out, ‘Lord, please save me’, and the Lord says, 'Where is
that glass of water l asked for?’

We think that changes in ourselves can come about in time, that order in
ourselves can be built up little by little, added to day by day. But time doesn’t
bring order or peace, so we must stop thinking in terms of gradualness. This
means that there is no tomorrow for us to be peaceful in. We have to be orderly
on the instant.
When there is real danger time disappears, doesn’t it? There is immediate
action. But we do not see the danger of many of our problems and therefore we
invent time as a means of overcoming them. Time is a deceiver as it doesn’t do a

man has divided into past, present and future, and as long as he divides it he will
always be in conflict.
Is learning a matter of time? We have not learnt after all these thousands of
years that there is a better way to live than by hating and killing each other. The
