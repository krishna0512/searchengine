So is fear perhaps the reason why you have not got the energy of that passion
to find out for yourself why this quality of love is missing in you, why there is not
this flame in your heart? If you have examined your own mind and heart very
closely, you will know why you haven’t got it. If you are passionate in your
discovery to find why you haven’t got it, you will know it is there. Through
complete negation alone, which is the highest form of passion, that thing which is
love, comes into being. Like humility you cannot cultivate love. Humility comes
into being when there is a total ending of conceit - then you will never know what
it is to be humble. A man who knows what it is to have humility is a vain man. In
the same way when you give your mind and your heart, your nerves, your eyes,
your whole being to find out the way of life, to see what actually is and go beyond
it, and deny completely, totally, the life you live now - in that very denial of the
ugly, the brutal, the other comes into being. And you will never know it either. A
man who knows that he is silent, who knows that he loves, does not know what
love is or What silence is.
