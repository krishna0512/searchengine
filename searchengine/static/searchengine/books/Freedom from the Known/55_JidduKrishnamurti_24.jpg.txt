are lucky, the window will open and the breeze will come in. Or it may not. It
depends on the state of your mind. And that state of mind can be understood only

opposing, never agreeing, never justifying, never condemning, never judging -
which means watching it without any choice. And out of this choiceless
awareness perhaps the door will open and you will know what that dimension is
in which there is no conflict and no time.
