very understanding of the structure of thinking is its own discipline which is
meditation.
Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it
is right or wrong but just to watch it and move with it. In that watching you begin
to understand the whole movement of thought and feeling. And out of this
awareness comes silence. Silence put together by thought is stagnation, is dead,
but the silence that comes when thought has understood its own beginning, the
nature of itself, understood how all thought is never free but always old - this
silence is meditation in which the meditatorÂ  is entirely absent, for the mind has
emptied itself of the past.
If you have read this book for a whole hour attentively, that is meditation. If
you have merely taken away a few words and gathered a few ideas to think about
later, then it is no longer meditation. Meditation is a state of mind which looks at
everything with complete attention, totally, not just parts of it. And no one can
teach you how to be attentive. If any system teaches you how to be attentive,
then you are attentive to the system and that is not attention. Meditation is one of
the greatest arts in life - perhaps the greatest, and one cannot possibly learn it
from anybody, that is the beauty of it. lt has no technique and therefore no
authority. When you learn about yourself, watch yourself, watch the way you
walk, how you eat, what you say, the gossip, the hate, the jealousy - if you are
aware of all that in yourself, without any choice, that is part of meditation.
So meditation can take place when you are sitting in a bus or walking in the
woods full of light and shadows, or listening to the singing of birds or looking at
the face of your wife or child.
In the understanding of meditation there is love, and love is not the product of
systems, of habits, of following a method. Love cannot be cultivated by thought.
Love can perhaps come into being when there is complete silence, a silence in
which the mediator is entirely absent; and the mind can be silent only when it
