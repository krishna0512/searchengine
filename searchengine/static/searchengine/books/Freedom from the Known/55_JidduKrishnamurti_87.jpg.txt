interpretation are based on yesterday’s knowledge and experience, so you will
invariably translate according to your conditioning. But if you look at the
statements and do not interpret them all but just give them your complete
attention not concentration) you will find there is neither the observer nor the
observed, neither the thinker nor the thought. Don’t say, Which began first?’ That
is a clever argument which leads nowhere. You can observe in yourself that as
long as there is no thought - which doesn’t mean a state of amnesia, of blankness
as long as there is no thought derived from memory, experience or knowledge,
which are all of the past, there is no thinker at all. This is not a philosophical or
mystical affair. We are dealing with actual facts, and you will see, if you have
gone this far in the journey, that you will respond to a challenge, not with the old
brain, but totally anew.
