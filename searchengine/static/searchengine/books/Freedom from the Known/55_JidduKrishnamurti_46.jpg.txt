Chapter 7
THE CESSATlON OF violence, which we have just been considering, does
not necessarily mean a state of mind which is at peace with itself and therefore at
peace in all its relationships.
Relationship between human beings is based on the image-forming, defensive
mechanism. In all our relationships each one of us builds an image about the

The wife has an image about the husband - perhaps not consciously but
nevertheless it is there - and the husband has an image about the wife. One has
an image about oneâ€™s country and about oneself, and we are always
strengthening these images by adding more and more to them. And it is these
mages which have relationship. The actual relationship between two human
beings or between many human beings completely end when there is the

the relationship because the images are fictitious and one cannot live in an
abstraction. And yet that is what we are all doing. living in ideas, in theories, in
symbols, in images which we have created about ourselves and others and which
are not realities at all. All our relationships, whether they be with property, ideas
or people, are based essentially on this image-forming, and hence there is always
conflict.

completely orderly inward life without any form of compulsion, imitation,
