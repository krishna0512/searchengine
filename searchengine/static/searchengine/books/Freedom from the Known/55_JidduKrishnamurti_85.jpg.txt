only breeds this duality in us, this contradiction, but it also accumulates the
innumerable memories we have had of pleasure and pain, and from these
memories it is reborn. So thought is the past, thought is always old, as l have
already said.
As every challenge is met in terms of the past - a challenge being always new
-Â  our meeting of the challenge will always be totally inadequate, hence
contradiction, conflict and all the misery and sorrow we are heir to. Our little brain
is in conflict whatever it does. Whether it aspires, imitates, conforms, suppresses,
sublimates, takes drugs to expand itself - whatever it does - it is in a state of
conflict and will produce conflict.
Those who think a great deal are very materialistic because thought is matter.
Thought is matter as much as the floor, the wall, the telephone, are matter.
Energy functioning in a pattern becomes matter. T here is energy and there is
matter. That is all life is. We may think thought is not matter but it is. Thought is
matter as an ideology. Where there is energy it becomes matter. Matter and
energy are interrelated. The one cannot exist without the other, and the more
harmony there is between the two, the more balance, the more active the brain
cells are. Thought has set up this pattern of pleasure, pain, fear, and has been
functioning inside it for thousands of years and cannot break the pattern because
it has created it.
A new fact cannot be seen by thought. It can be understood later by thought,
verbally, but the understanding of a new fact is not reality to thought. Thought can
never solve any psychological problem. However clever, however cunning,
however erudite, whatever the structure thought creates through science, through
an electronic brain, through compulsion or necessity, thought is never new and
therefore it can never answer any tremendous question. The old brain cannot
solve the enormous problem of living.
