of your pleasures, the smallest or the greatest, naturally, without any enforcement
or argument, then you will know what it means to die. To die is to have a mind
that is completely empty of itself, empty of its daily longing, pleasure; and
agonies. Death is a renewal, a mutation, in which thought does not function at all
because thought is old. When there is death there is something totally new.
Freedom from the known is death, and then you are living.
