Chapter 5
Before we go any further l would like to ask you what is your fundamental,
lasting interest in life? Putting all oblique answers aside and dealing with this
question directly and honestly, what would you answer? Do you know?
Isn’t it yourself? Anyway, that is what most of us would say if we answered

want. When we say we want freedom we want it because we think it may be
wonderfully satisfying, and the ultimate satisfaction, of course, is this peculiar
