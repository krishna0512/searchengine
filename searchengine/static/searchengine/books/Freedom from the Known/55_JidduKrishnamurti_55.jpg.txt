domination. In this way you can have a chain of reactions and accept each
reaction as freedom. But it is not freedom, it is merely a continuity of a modified
past which the mind clings to.
The youth of today, like all youth, are in revolt against society, and that is a
good thing in itself, but revolt is not freedom because when you revolt it is a
reaction and that reaction sets up its own pattern and you get caught in that
pattern. You think it is something new. it is not, it is the old in a different mould.
Any social or political revolt will inevitably revert to the good old bourgeois
mentality.
Freedom comes only when you see and act, never through revolt. The seeing
is the acting and such action is as instantaneous as when you see danger. Then
there is no cerebration, no discussion or hesitation, the danger itself compels the
act, and therefore to see is to act and to be free.
Freedom is a state of mind - not freedom from something but a sense of
freedom, a freedom to doubt and question everything and therefore so intense,
active and Vigorous that it throws away every form of dependence, slavery,
conformity and acceptance. Such freedom implies being completely alone. But
can the mind brought up in a culture so dependent on environment and its own
tendencies ever find that freedom which is complete solitude and in which there is
no leadership, no tradition and no authority?
This solitude is an inward state of mind which is not dependent on any
stimulus or any knowledge and is not the result of any experience or conclusion.
Most of us, inwardly, are never alone. There is a difference between isolation -
cutting oneself off, and aloneness, solitude. We all know what it is to be isolated -
building a wall around oneself in order never to be hurt, never to be vulnerable, or
cultivating detachment which is another form of agony, or living in some dreamy
ivory tower of ideology. Aloneness is something quite different.
