Chapter 1
Man has throughout the ages been seeking something beyond himself,
beyond material welfare - something we call truth or God or reality, a timeless
state - something that cannot be disturbed by circumstances, by thought or by
human corruption.
Man has always asked the question. what is it all about? Has life any meaning
at all ? He sees the enormous confusion of life, the brutalities, the revolt, the wars,
the endless divisions of religion, ideology and nationality, and with a sense of
deep abiding frustration he asks, what is one to do, what is this thing we call
living, is there anything beyond it?
And not finding this nameless thing of a thousand names which he has always
sought, he has cultivated faith - faith in a saviour or an ideal - and faith invariably
breeds violence’
In this constant battle which we call living, we try to set a code of conduct
according to the society in which we are brought up, whether it be a Communist
society or a so-called free society, we accept a standard of behaviour as part of
our tradition as Hindus or Muslims or Christians or whatever we happen to be.
We look to someone to tell us what is right or wrong behaviour, what is right or
wrong thought, and in following this pattern our conduct and our thinking become
mechanical, our responses automatic. We can observe this very easily in
ourselves.
For centuries we have been spoon-fed by our teachers, by our authorities, by
our books, our saints. We say, ‘Tell me all about it - what lies beyond the hills and
the mountains and the earth?’ and we are satisfied with their descriptions, which
means that we live on words and our life is shallow and empty. We are
secondhand people. We have lived on what we have been told, either guided by
our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to accept by circumstances and
