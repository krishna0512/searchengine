environment. We are the result of all kinds of influences and there is nothing new,
in us, nothing that we have discovered for ourselves; nothing original, pristine,
clear.
Throughout theological history we have been assured by religious leaders that
if we perform certain rituals, repeat certain prayers or mantras, conform to certain
patterns, suppress our desires, control our thoughts, sublimate our passions, limit
our appetites and refrain from sexual indulgence, we shall, after sufficient torture
of the mind and body, find something beyond this little life. And that is what
millions of so-called religious people have done through the ages, either in
isolation, going off into the desert or into the mountains or a cave or wandering
from village to village with a begging bowl, or, in a group, joining a monastery,
forcing their minds to conform to an established pattern. But a tortured mind, a
broken mind, a mind which wants to escape from all turmoil, which has denied
the outer world and been made dull through dis- cipline and conformity - such a
mind, however long it seeks, will find only according to its own distortion.
So to discover whether there actually is or is not something beyond this
anxious, guilty, fearful, competitive existence, it seems to me that one must have
a completely different approach altogether. The traditional approach is from the
periphery inwards, and through time, practice and renunciation, gradually to come
upon that inner flower, that inner beauty and love - in fact to do everything to
make oneself narrow, petty and shoddy, peel off little by little; take time; tomorrow
will do, next life will do - and when at last one comes to the centre one finds there
is nothing there, because oneâ€™s mind has been made incapable, dull and
insensitive.
Having observed this process, one asks oneself, is there not a different
approach altogether - that is, is it not possible to explode from the centre?
The world accepts and follows the traditional approach. The primary cause of
disorder in ourselves is the seeking of reality promised by another; we
