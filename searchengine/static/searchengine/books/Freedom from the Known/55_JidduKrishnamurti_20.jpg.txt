Chapter 3
When you become aware of your conditioning you will understand the whole of
your consciousness. Consciousness is the total field in which thought functions
and relationships exist. All motives, intentions, desires, pleasures, fear,
inspiration, longings, hopes, sorrows, joys are in that field. But we have come to
divide the consciousness into the active and the dormant, the upper and lower
level - that is, all the daily thoughts, feelings and activities on the surface and
below them the so-called subconscious, the things with which we are not familiar,
which express themselves occasionally through certain intimations, intuitions and
dreams.
We are occupied with one little corner of consciousness which is most of our
life; the rest, which we call the subconscious, with all its motives, its fears, its
racial and inherited qualities, we do not even know how to get into. Now l am
asking you, is there such a thing as the subconscious at all? We use that word
very freely. We have accepted that there is such a thing and all the phrases and
jargon of the analysts and psychologists have seeped into the language, but is
there such a thing? And why is it that we give such extraordinary importance to
it? It seems to me that it is as trivial and stupid as the conscious mind - as
arrow, bigoted, conditioned, anxious and tawdry.
So is it possible to be totally aware of the whole field of consciousness and not
merely a part, a fragment, of it? If you are able to be aware of the totality, then
you are functioning all the time with your total attention, not partial attention. This
is important to understand because when you are being totally aware of the
whole field of consciousness there no friction. it is only when you divide
consciousness, which is all thought, feeling and action, into different levels that
there is friction.
