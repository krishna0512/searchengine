Is it possible to meet every issue without this space-time interval, without the
gap between oneself and the thing of which one is afraid? It is possible only when
the observer has no continuity, the observer who is the builder of the image, the
observer who is a collection of memories and ideas, who is a bundle of
abstractions.
When you look at the stars there is you who are looking at the stars in the sky;
the sky is flooded with brilliant stars, there is cool air, and there is you, the
observer, the experiencer, the thinker, you with your aching heart, you, the
centre, creating space. You will never understand about the space between
yourself and the stars, yourself and your wife or husband, or friend, because you
have never looked without the image, and that is why you do not know what
beauty is or what love is. You talk about it, you write about it, but you have never
known it except perhaps at rare intervals of total self-abandonment. So long as
there is a centre creating space around itself there is neither love nor beauty.
When there is no centre and no circumference then there is love. And when you
love you are beauty.
When you look at a face opposite, you are looking from a centre and the
centre creates the space between person and person, and that is why our lives
are so empty and callous. You cannot cultivate love or beauty, nor can you invent
truth, but if you are all the time aware of what you are doing, you can cultivate
awareness and out of that awareness you will begin to see the nature of
pleasure, desire and sorrow and the utter loneliness and boredom of man, and
then you will begin to come upon that thing called the spaceâ€™.
When there is space between you and the object you are observing you will
know there is no love, and without love, however hard you try to reform the world
or bring about a new social order or however much you talk about improvements,
you will only create agony. So it is up to you. There is no leader, there is no
