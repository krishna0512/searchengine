things, always moving, flowing, never resting. When we look at ourselves with the
dead authority of yesterday, we will fail to understand the living movement and
the beauty and quality of that movement.
To be free of all authority, of your own and that of another, is to die to
everything of yesterday, so that your mind is always fresh, always young,
innocent, full of vigour and passion. It is only in that state that one learns and
observes. And for this a great deal of awareness is required, actual awareness of
what is going on inside yourself, without correcting it or telling it what it should or
should not be, because the moment you correct it you have established another
authority, a censor.
So now we are going to investigate ourselves together - not one person
explaining while you read, agreeing or disagreeing with him as you follow the
words on the page, but taking a journey together, a journey of discovery into the
most secret corners of our minds. And to take such a journey we must travel light;
we cannot be burdened with opinions, prejudices and conclusions - all that old
furniture we have collected for the last two thousand years and more. Forget all
you know about yourself, forget all you have ever thought about yourself; we are
going to start as if we knew nothing.
It rained last night heavily, and now the skies are beginning to clear, it is a new
fresh day. Let us meet that fresh day as if it were the only day. Let us start on our
journey together with all the remembrance of yesterday left behind - and begin to
understand ourselves for the first time.
