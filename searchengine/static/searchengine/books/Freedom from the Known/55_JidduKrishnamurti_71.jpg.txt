Love is something that is new, fresh, alive. It has no yesterday and no
tomorrow. It is beyond the turmoil of thought. It is only the innocent mind which
knows what love is, and the innocent mind can live in the world which is not
innocent. To find this extraordinary thing which man has sought endlessly through
sacrifice, through worship, through relationship, through sex, through every form
of pleasure and pain, is only possible when thought comes to understand itself
and comes naturally to an end. Then love has no opposite, then love has no
conflict.
You may ask,'If l find such a love, what happens to my wife, my children, my
family? They must have security.’ When you put such a question you have never
been outside the field of thought, the field of consciousness. When once you
have been outside that field you will never ask such a question because then you
will know what love is in which there is no thought and therefore no time. You
may read this mesmerized and enchanted, but actually to go beyond thought and
time - which means going beyond sorrow - is to be aware that there is a different
dimension called love.’
But you don’t know how to come to this extraordinary fount - so what do you
do? If you don’t know what to do, you do nothing, don’t you? Absolutely nothing.
Then inwardly you are completely silent. Do you understand what that means? It
means that you are not seeking, not wanting, not pursuing, there is no centre at
all.Then there is love.
