smoking or sex or whatever it is - have you noticed what battles you go through?
And all that is a form of fear, isn’t it? You are afraid of not getting what you want
or of losing what you have. When some particular faith or ideology which you
have held for years is shaken or torn away from you by logic or life, aren’t you
afraid of standing alone? That belief has for years given you satisfaction and
pleasure, and when it is taken away you are left stranded, empty, and the fear
remains until you find another form of pleasure, another belief.
It seems to me so simple and because it is so simple we refuse to see its
simplicity. We like to complicate everything. When your wife turns away from you,
aren’t you jealous? Aren’t you angry? Don’t you hate the man who has attracted
her? And what is all that but fear of losing something which has given you a great
deal of pleasure, a companionship, a certain quality of assurance and the
satisfaction of possession?
So if you understand that where there is a search for pleasure there must be
pain, live that way if you want to, but don’t just slip into it. If you want to end
pleasure, though, which is to end pain, you must be totally attentive to the whole
structure of pleasure - not cut it out as monks and sannyasis do, never looking at
a woman because they think it is a sin and thereby destroying the vitality of their
understanding - but seeing the whole meaning and significance of pleasure. Then
you will have tremendous joy in life. You cannot think about joy. Joy is an
immediate thing and by thinking about it, you turn it into pleasure. Living in the
present is the instant perception of beauty and the great delight in it without
seeking pleasure from it.
