us are not aware, not only of what we are talking about but of our environment,
the colours around us, the people, the shape of the trees, the clouds, the
movement of water. Perhaps it is because we are so concerned with ourselves,
with our own petty little problems, our own ideas, our own pleasures, pursuits and
ambitions that we are not objectively aware. And yet we talk a great deal about
awareness. Once in India I was travelling in a car. There was a chauffeur driving
and l was sitting beside him. T here were three gentlemen behind discussing
awareness very intently and asking me questions about awareness, and
unfortunately at that moment the driver was looking somewhere else and he ran
over a goat, and the three gentlemen were still discussing awareness - totally
unaware that they had run over a goat. When the lack of attention was pointed
out to those gentlemen who were trying to be aware it was a great surprise to
them.
And with most of us it is the same. We are not aware of outward things or of
inward things. If you want to understand the beauty of a bird, a fly, or a leaf, or a
person with all his complexities, you have to give your whole attention which is
awareness. And you can give your whole attention only when you care, which
means that you really love to understand - then you give your whole heart and
ind to find out.
Such awareness is like living with a snake in the room, you watch ifs every
movement, you are very, very sensitive to the slightest sound it makes. Such a
state of attention is total energy, in such awareness the totality of yourself is
revealed in an instant.
When you have looked at yourself so deeply you can go much deeper. When
we use the word deeper’ we are not being comparative. We think in comparisons
deep and shallow, happy and unhappy. We are always measuring, comparing.
Now is there such a state as the shallow and the deep in oneself ? When l say,
My mind is shallow, petty, narrow, limited’, how do l know all these things?
