he did, or tried to do, something about it, but when the observer realizes that he is
that, then there is no like or dislike and conflict ceases.
For what is he to do? If something is you, what can you do? You cannot rebel
against it or run away from it or even accept it. It is there. So all action that is the
outcome of reaction to like-and dislike has come to an end.
Then you will find that there is an awareness that has become tremendously
alive. It is not bound to any central issue or to any image - and from that intensity
of awareness there is a different quality of attention and therefore the mind -
because the mind is this awareness - has become extraordinarily sensitive and
highly intelligent.
