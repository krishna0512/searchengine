Chapter 11
WE HAVE BEEN enquiring into the nature of love and have come to a point, I
think, which needs much greater penetration, a much greater awareness of the
issue. We have discovered that for most people love means comfort, security, a
guarantee for the rest of their lives of continuous emotional satisfaction. Then
someone like me comes along and says, ‘ls that really love”?’ and questions you
and asks you to look inside yourself. And you try not to look because it is very
disturbing - you would rather discuss the soul or the political or economic
situation - but when you are driven into a corner to look, you realize that what you
have always thought of as love is not love at all; it is a mutual gratification, a
mutual exploitation’
When l say, ’Love has no tomorrow and no yesterday’, or,When there is no
centre then there is love’, it has reality for me but not for you. You may quote it
and make it into a formula but that has no validity. You have to see it for yourself,
but to do so there must be freedom to look, freedom from all condemnation, all
judgement all agreeing or disagreeing.
Now, to look is one of the most difficult things in life - or to listen - to look and
listen are the same. If your eyes are blinded with your worries, you cannot see
the beauty of the sunset. Most of us have lost touch with nature. Civiliza- tion is
tending more and more towards large cities, we are becoming more and more an
urban people, living in crowded apartments and having very little space even to
look at the sky of an evening and morning, and therefore we are losing touch with
a great deal of beauty. l don’t know if you have noticed how few of us look at a
sunrise or a sunset or the moonlight or the reflection of light on water.
Having lost touch with nature we naturally tend to develop intellectual
capacities. We read a great many books, go to a great many museums and
concerts, watch television and have many other entertainments. We quote
