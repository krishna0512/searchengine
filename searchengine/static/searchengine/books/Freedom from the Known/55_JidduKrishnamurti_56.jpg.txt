You are never alone because you are full of all the memories, all the
conditioning, all the mutterings of yesterday, your mind is never clear of all the
rubbish it has accumulated. T o be alone you must die to the past. When you are
alone, totally alone, not belonging to any family, any nation, any culture, any
particular continent, there is that sense of being an outsider. T he man who is
completely alone in this way is innocent and it is this innocency that frees the
ind from sorrow.
We carry about with us the burden of what thousands of people have said and
the memories of all our misfortunes. To abandon all that totally is to be alone, and
the mind that is alone is not only innocent but young - not in time or age, but
young, innocent, alive at whatever age - and only such a mind can see that which
is truth and that which is not measurable by words.
In this solitude you will begin to understand the necessity of living with yourself
as you are, not as you think you should be or as you have been. See if you can
look at yourself without any tremor, any false modesty, any fear, any justification
or condemnation - just live with yourself as you actually are. It is only when you
live with something intimately that you begin to understand it. But the moment
you get used to it - get used to your own anxiety or envy or whatever it is - you
are no longer living with it. If you live by a river, after a few days you do not hear
the sound of the water any more, or if you have a picture in the room which you
see every day you lose it after a week. It is the same with the mountains, the
valleys, the frees - the same with your family, your husband, your wife. But to live
with something like jealousy, envy or anxiety you must never get used to it, never
accept it. You must care for it as you would care for a newly planted tree, protect
it against the sun, against the storm. You must care for it, not condemn it or justify
it.Therefore you begin to love it. When you care for it, you are beginning to love
it. It is not that you love being envious or anxious, as so many people do, but
rather that you care for watching.
