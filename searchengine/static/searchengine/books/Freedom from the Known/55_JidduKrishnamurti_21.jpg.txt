We live in fragments. You are one thing at the office, another at home; you
talk about democracy and in your heart you are autocratic, you talk about loving
your neighbours, yet kill him with competition, there is one part of you working,
looking, independently of the other. Are you aware of this fragmentary existence
n yourself? And is it possible for a brain that has broken up its own functioning,
