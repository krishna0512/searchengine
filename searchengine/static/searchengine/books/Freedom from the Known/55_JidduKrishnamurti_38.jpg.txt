Chapter B
FEAR, PLEASURE SORROW, thought and violence are all interrelated. Most
of us take pleasure in violence, in disliking somebody, hating a particular race or
group of people, having antagonistic feelings towards others. But in a state of
mind in which all violence has come to an end there is a joy which is very
different from the pleasure of violence with its conflicts, hatreds and fears.
Can we go to the very root of violence and be free from it? Otherwise we shall
live everlastingly in battle with each other. lf that is the way you want to live - and
apparently most people do - then carry on, if you say, Well, I’m sorry, violence
can never end’, then you and l have no means of communication, you have
blocked yourself, but if you say there might be a different way of living, then we
shall be able to communicate with each other.
So let us consider together, those of us who can communicate, whether it is at
all possible totally to end every form of violence in ourselves and still live in this
monstrously brutal world. I think it is possible. I don’t want to have a breath of
hate, jealousy, anxiety or fear in me. I want to live completely at peace. Which
doesn’t mean that l want to die. I want to live on this marvellous earth, so full, so
rich, so beautiful. l want to look at the trees, flowers, rivers, meadows, women,
boys and girls, and at the same time live completely at peace with myself and
with the world. What can l do?
f we know how to look at Violence, not only outwardly in society - the wars,
the riots, the national antagonisms and class conflicts - but also in ourselves, then
perhaps we shall be able to go beyond it.
Here is a very complex problem. For centuries upon centuries man has been
violent; religions have tried to tame him throughout the world and none of them
have succeeded. So if we are going into the question we must, it seems to me
be at least very serious about it because it will lead us into quite a different
