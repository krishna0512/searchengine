Chapter 12
PLEASE GO ON with me a little further. It may be rather complex, rather
subtle, but please go on with it.
Now, when l build an image about you or about anything, l am able to watch
that image, so there is the image and the observer of the image. l see someone,
say, with a red shirt on and my immediate reaction is that l like it or that l don’t
like it. The like or dislike is the result of my culture, my training, my associations,
my inclinations, my acquired and inherited characteristics. It is from that centre
that l observe and make my judgement, and thus the observer is separate from
the thing he observes.
But the observer is aware of more than one image; he creates thousands of
mages. But is the observer different from these images? Isn’t he just another
mage? He is always adding to and subtracting from what he is; he is a living
thing all the time weighing, comparing, judging, modifying and changing as a
result of pressures from outside and within - living in the field of consciousness
which is his own knowledge, influence and innumerable calculations. At the same
time when you look at the observer, who is yourself, you see that he is made up
of memories, experiences, accidents, influences, traditions and infinite varieties of
suffering, all of which are the past. So the observer is both the past and the
present, and tomorrow is waiting and that is also a part of him. He is half alive
and half dead and with this death and life he is looking, with the dead and living
leaf. And in that state of mind which is within the field of time, you (the observer)
look at fear, at jealousy, at war, at the family (that ugly enclosed entity called the
family) and try to solve the problem of the thing observed which is the challenge,
the new, you are always translating the new in terms of the old and therefore you
are everlastingly in conflict.
