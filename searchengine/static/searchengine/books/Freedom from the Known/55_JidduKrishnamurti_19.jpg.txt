you act? ls it because you are lazy, laziness being lack of energy? Yet you will
not lack energy if you see an immediate physical danger like a snake in your
path, or a precipice, or a fire. Why, then, don’t you act when you see the danger
of your conditioning? If you saw the danger of nationalism to your own security,
wouldn’t you act?
The answer is you don’t see. Through an intellectual process of analysis you
may see that nationalism leads to self-destruction but there is no emotional
content in that. Only when there is an emotional content do you become vital.
If you see the danger of your conditioning merely as an intellectual concept,
you will never do anything about it. In seeing a danger as a mere idea there is
conflict between the idea and action and that conflict takes away your energy. It is
only when you see the conditioning and the danger of it immediately, and as you
would see a precipice, that you act. So seeing is acting!
Most of us walk through life inattentively, reacting unthinkingly according to the
environment in which we have been brought up, and such reactions create only
further bondage, further conditioning, but the moment you give your total attention
to your conditioning you will see that you are free from the past completely, that it
falls away from you naturally.
