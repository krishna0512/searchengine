Electric robots use batteries or extension wires plugged into the standard AC system
Hydraulic robots need pumps to pressurize the hydraulic fluid, and pneumatic robots need air
compressors. Some robots may also run on fuels like petrol and compressed natural gas
(CNG). Scientists are working on creating nuclear-powered robots for outer space
applications-an enterprise which is now in the design stage.
4. An electrical circuit: This powers the electric motor, solenoid or valves that control the
hydraulic or pneumatic systems.
5. A reprogrammable brain (which is actually a computer): The computer acts as the head of
the robot and controls all other components. To change the robot&rsquo;s behaviour, to increase its
speed, improve its accuracy or even modify Its basic functionalities, you just have to
reprogramme the computer.
6. A sensory system: While most robots are designed for preset roles, some robots are now
created to react to the environment and the presence of humans or even other robots. These
robots have the ability to collect information about their environment,and react to it. This may
be in the form of a camera, infrared sensors, sound sensors and heat sensors The information
gathered by thee Sensors is sent to the central computer to determine What reaction is
required from the robot.
In human beings, these six parts would roughly correspond to the body; our muscles; air, water and
food that power us; our veins and nerves; the brain; and our sense organs
