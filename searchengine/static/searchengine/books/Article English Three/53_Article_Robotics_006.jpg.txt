Sojourner, used in the Mars mission Pathfinder, cost about S25 million (Rs 70 crores). This is about
one-third of the price of a passenger airplane like Boeing 737.
However, small robots can cost Just a few thousand rupees and can even be made at home.
Will robots take over the world and destroy humanity?
No. As long as humans have the ability to think, innovate and dream big, robots can never overtake
humanity. A robot&rsquo;s brain is just a computer which can only do what It is told to do. If there are bugs
in the computer, one can always sort them out-Just the way an antivirus software cleans a computer
But still, what if they become stronger and more intelligent than
humans?
No, they can only be as strong as we want them to be and do only the things we ask them to do. They
can certainly never innovate on their own. Don&rsquo;t worry
What is the most exciting robotics challenge competition around?
lt i arguably the DARPA Robotic challenge which seeks to promote ideas and designs of semi-
autonomous robots that can undertake difficult and dangerous tasks in environments unsuitable for
humans. The competition began in 2012 and its finals were held n December 2014 A robot had to
perform  the following basic functions to quality for the DARPA Robotic Challenge:
1. Drive a  utility vehicle at the site
2. Travel dismounted across rubble
3.Remove debris blocking an entryway
4.Open a door and enter a building
5.Climb an Industrial ladder and traverse an industrial walkway
6. Use a tool tn break through a concrete pane
7. Locate and close a valve near a leaking pipe
8: Conneet a fire hose tn a standpipe and tarn on a valve
Till date, eleven teams have won a spot in the finals. The purpose of this challenge is to help build
robots which can save humans from operating in dangerous and life-threatening situations.
Are there robotic sports competitions?
