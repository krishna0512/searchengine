GENERAL WASHINGTON                                         101
 England on leave for the winter. Angling for an inde-
 pendent command, Burgoyne convinced Germain that he
 had a master stroke to propose: a converging advance upon
 the focal point of Albany by three forces &mdash; with Burgoyne
 himself at the head &mdash; from the north, out of Montreal.
 Germain also sanctioned this scheme.
 Here the inadequacies in the British system of command
 became crucial. As befitted one who was an amateur play-
 wright, Burgoyne&rsquo;s plan had a certain dramatic symmetry.
 But like its author&rsquo;s literary productions it was, while im-
 posing in conception, weak in detail. It paid little heed to
 the problems of co-ordinating three separate attacks, or
 of movement and supply in the rough terrain between
 Montreal and Albany. It assumed that merely to arrive in
 Albany was to have won a major victory: New England
 would be isolated; the colonies would be carved into seg-
 ments like some succulent turkey. But would they? Could
 the British keep their communications open; could they
 possibly hope to prevent American parties from moving
 across the extended line?
 Howe&rsquo;s amended plan was superior, if it meant dealing
 with Washington&rsquo;s army. There, if anywhere, lay the heart
 of the rebellion. During the spring and early summer
 Cornwallis attempted rather perfunctorily to get to grips
 with Washington. But the latter was by now too skilled in
 adversity to accept the challenge, and dodged away.
 Howe in the interim changed his mind again. His new
 idea was to capture Philadelphia by sea, in a great naval
 operaion for which he wet aside fifteen thousand of his best
 troops. This meant that no regulars could be spared for a
 push north from New York City, only some loyalist bands
