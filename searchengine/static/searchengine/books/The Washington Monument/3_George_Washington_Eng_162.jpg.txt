PRESIDENT WASHINGTON 147
 Hancock in Massachusetts, and &mdash; in Washington&rsquo;s own
 state &mdash; Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, Edmund Ran-
 dolph, even his old friend and neighbor George Mason.
 Nine out of thirteen states had to approve the Constitu-
 tion for it to be adopted. By January 1788  five states had
ratified. In February Massachusetts came in by a narrow
 margin, swayed by the Federalist intimation to Hancock
 that he might be Vice-President, or even (if Virginia failed
 to ratify and Washington was thereby excluded) President
 under the new government. Hancock was won over. What
 was more, he introduced a valuable formula that was
 followed by other states: Massachusetts would accept the
 Constitution on the understanding that amendments would
 subsequentiy be adopted that would meet the criticisms
 raised against the document. These would amount to a
 Bill of Rights, similar to the provisions already incorpo-
 rated in various state constitutions.
 Two more states came in, making a total of eight; and
 Virginia, the most crucial of all, came in at the end of
 June after a tense struggle. Better still, it was learned in
 Virginia that New Hampshire had already ratified. Ten
 states were in, one more than the necessary minimum.
 Alexander Hamilton and other ardent Federalists in New
 York used the glad news to disarm opposition in that
 state. A year after the delegates dispersed from Philadel-
 phia, the Constitution they had drawn up was sanctioned,
 with or without reservations, by eleven out of thirteen
 states. Only North Carolina and Rhode Island stood out-
 side. They obstinacy, though unfortunate, was not fatal.
 What next? For the nation as a whole, it remained for
 Congress to wind itself up and for a new Congress to be
