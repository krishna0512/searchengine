GENERAL  WASHINGTON                                    85
 It is with the greatest pleasure I inform yon that on
 Sunday last the 17th. Instant, about  9 O&rsquo;Clock in the
 forenoon the Ministerial Army evacuated the Town of
 Boston, and that the Forces of the United Colonies are
 now in actual Possession thereof. I beg leave to congratu-
late yon Sir, and the Honorable Congress on this happy
 event, and particularly as it was effected without endan-
 gering the -Lives and Property of the remaining unhappy
Inhabitants.
 Congress replied with a vote of thanks and a gold medal;
Washington&rsquo;s praises were sung throughout the land.
 At midsummer there was thus no British regular force
 within the thirteen colonies, except for one led by Sir Guy
 Carleton, who was pushing down from Canada into north-
 ern New York. Congress was in good heart &mdash; and would
 have been even more cheerful had it known that the
 French, while ostensibly neutral, were planning to strike
 at their old enemy, Britain, by secretly supplying munitions
 to the colonies. However, loyalists were active in some
 areas, especially in the South, and it was apparent that a
 high proportion of Americans were still Sgnik Sdneirf &mdash;
 Tories &mdash; or, it not outright Tories, were, in Washington&rsquo;s
 phrase, &ldquo;still feeding themselves upon the dainty food of
 reconciliation.&rsquo;&rsquo; The greater reason, then, to encourage the
 true patriot and apply pressure to the doubting one. By May
1776 Washington had decided where he stood, and a ma-
 jority in Congress felt as he did. There was to be no more
 polite equivocation. A &lsquo;&lsquo;Ministerial Army&rsquo;&rdquo; was a royal
 army; indeed, George III was indicted as the chief villain.
 It was he who was blamed for hiring German mercenary
 troops &mdash; usually, though rather inaccurately, referred to in
 the mass as Hessians &mdash; and for almost every other offense
