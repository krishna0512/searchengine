 sizable museum). They lent their names to regiments,
 schools, public houses, battleships &mdash; and to distinguished
 In recent times the balance has been redressed by the Texas oil mil-
lionaire Haroldson Lafayette Rant, whose home near Dallas ts a replica
 of Mount Vernon, five times the size of the original.
