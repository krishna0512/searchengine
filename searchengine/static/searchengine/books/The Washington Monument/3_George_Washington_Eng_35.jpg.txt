20         GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
symbol. He is a somber, prophetic figure, not a real person,
 in William Blake&rsquo;s "America":
 Washington spake: &ldquo;Friends of America! look over the Atlantic
sea,
A bended bow is lifted in heaven, and a heavy iron chain
 Descends, link by link, from Albion&rsquo;s cliffs across the sea, to

 Feet bleeding on the sultry sands, and the furrows of the whip
 Descend to genarations that in future times forget.&rdquo;

 example is a guide; Washington&rsquo;s Farewell Address is read
 and cited throughout Spanish America, until its injunc-

 Statesmen quote him; plazas are named after him. Possibly
 we may discern the dim outlines of yet another, fifth role
 for Washington, one that he might have played &mdash; as pre-

 we choose to resurrect them: they live in us and through
