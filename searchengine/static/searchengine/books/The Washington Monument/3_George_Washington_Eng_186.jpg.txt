PRESIDENT WASHINGTON                      171
 many Americans (Hamilton prominent among them) the
land of George III and William Pitt was still, with all her
 faults, a near relation. The bulk of American overseas
 trade was with the British Empire; if it were suspended,
 Hamilton&rsquo;s revenae system would collapse. Again, repub-
 licanism in America was a different proposition from re-
 publicanism in Europe, where it was ushered in by bloody
 revolution. American Tories were merely tarred and feath-
 ered; French aristos, like their king, perished on the scaf-
 fold. For a while Washington&rsquo;s dear friend Lafayette was
 among the leaders in France, until he fell into diagrace
 in 1792 and lay for four years in the dubious sanctuary
 of an Austrian jail. At that, he was luckier than most of
 his comrades.
America&rsquo;s obvious course, as Washington saw it and as
 even his quarreling advisers agreed at the outset, was to
remain neutral; and this was the policy he promptly an-
 nounced in a proclamation. As a polite concession to
 French opinion (and to Jefferson, who urged the point) he
 did not actually use the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; in the docu-
 ment. He signified approval of the new French govern-
 ment by preparing to receive its minister, Citizen Genet.
 So much was clear and precise; then for a while every-
 thing in America appeared to be an angry chaos. For if
 America was officially neutral, individual Americans were
 not. They had tended to take sides from the very out-
 break of the French Revolution; now their enthusiasms
 were inflamed to an astonishing degree. &lsquo;&lsquo;Gallomen&rsquo;&rsquo; made
 Tom Paine&rsquo;s Rights of Man their Bible, damned aristoc-
 racy and harrahed for liberty, formed themselves into
 Democratic clubs and gave Genet a tremendous welcome
