78 GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 offered to raise and lead to Boston a regiment of a thousand
 Virginians, paying for them out of his own pocket. The
 rumor seems to be entitely without foundation, though
 biographers have often repeated it as true. But it shows
 how eagerly the men at Philadelphia cast about for evi-
 dences of greatness, for the lineaments of the altogether
 exceptional man. In Sam Adams and other Congress had
 patriots who could rouse a rabble; its; imperative need was
 for someone who could discipline and lead a rabble, who
 could both look and behave like a commander on the
 European model and yet be a true American.
 &lsquo;There was one other important consideration. so far, the
 clash had been confined to New England. If the other
 colonies were to join in fully, the command of the proposed
 Continental army would. have to be given &mdash; as John and
 Samuel Adams realized &mdash; to a soldier from outside New
 England. With Massachusetts, Virginia held pre-eminence
 in colonial power. As a Virginian, George Washington was
 therefore all the more eligible. In the parlance of more re-
 cent American history, he was the &ldquo;available&rsquo;&rsquo; candidate,
 and his subordinate major generals were appointed with
 due regard fot the political and other factors involved:
 Attemas Ward to appease Massachusetts; the much-traveled
 Charles Lee for his military sophistication; Philip Schuyler
 (another delegate, a rich man and a seasoned military of-
ficer) to satisty New York; and Israet Putnam as a favorite
 son and folk hero of Connecticut. Horatio Gates, British by
birth and a Virginian by adoption, was appointed adjutant
 general. As their juniors, several brigadier generals were
 chosen from similarly mixed motives.
 Perhaps it is misleading to use the word &lsquo;&ldquo;candidate&rsquo;&rdquo; in
