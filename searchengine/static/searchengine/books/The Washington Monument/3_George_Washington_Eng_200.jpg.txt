THE WHOLE MAN                             185
 for a full-length portrait is there, both in his own words
 and in abundant comment about him.
 Why, then, the enigma, the confession that George
 Washington has eluded us? Why, when all the lineaments
 seem so sharp, is the portrait so strangely opaque? There
 are two main reasons: the nature of his personality, and
 the vast shadow thrown by the Washington legend&mdash; the
Washington Monument. His personality baffles because it
 presents the mystery of no mystery. In examining the ca-
 reers of the great, we are accustomed to look for&mdash; and to
 find &mdash; disguised clues or evidences of frailty. We can
 discern in some the passionate ambition of the parvenu, or
 the truculence common in men of small physique (both of
 these factors help to explain the behavior of a Napoleon or
 an Alexander Hamilton). Others are possessed by an
 ideological demon; they have heard voices, whose peremp-
 tory summons they follow to the death, if need be. In
 some the will to action springs from deeply secret sources
 (as, for instance, in the hidden homosexuality of the Brit-
 ish hero General Gordon). In most, the splendor is offset
 by a blemish &mdash; promiscuity, avarice, vanity. Yet what clues
 do we need or can we detect to uncover Washington &mdash;
 tall, handsome gentleman of middling views, modest, ab-
 stemious, culprit in nothing except perhaps an early and
 circumspect longing for Sally Fairfax? Was he, then, a
mediocrity? The monument inhibits an answer. Each
 would-be impartial historian must either, it appear, sur-
 render to conventional piety or else descend to petty fault
finding. It is not much consolation to reflect that the same
 awkward choice, between adulation and vandalism, faced
Washington&rsquo;s contemporaries.
