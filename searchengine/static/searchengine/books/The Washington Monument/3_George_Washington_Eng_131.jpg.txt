 to employ its garrison more profitabiy elsewhere. They had
 seized Savannah, in Georgia, a year earlier; and in the
 autumn of 1780 Clinton brought an army by sea to Charles-
 ton and laid siege to it. His operations were cumbersome,
 but they achieved the desired resuIt. Charleston fell, and
 with it, in the most costly setback of the war, a force of
