166    GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 tion, Both Hamilton and Jefferson respected the President
 and believed they were loyal to him and to their different
 ideas of the Union. In his presence they did not squabble.
Their grievances were directed at one another, not at
Washington; and each, it must be said, admired the other
 while distrusting him. Though there was a feud, there
 was not a hopeless crisis. If Washington was a somewhat

 also, he realized the flaws in Hamilton&rsquo;s temperament
 &mdash;a knowledge he must have gained at least as early as
1781, when Hamilton, after an imagined slight, withdrew
from Washington&rsquo;s headquarters in a fit of pique.

serious illnesses &mdash; a tamor on the thigh in 1789 and a
 bout of pneumonia in 1790; and tn his letters we find
 several references to his weakening powers of memory.
 He was aging, and Mount Vernon seemed increasingly
