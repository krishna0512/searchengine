THE WHOLE MAN                                           209
 TThe proper course, apparently, would have been to carry

 of such virtue are honorific &mdash; and largely posthumous.*

 as pragmatic and down-to-earth. So it is, in part (and so,
 in fact, was Washington&rsquo;s mentality). But in comparison
 with the dense, shrewd, worldly British texture from which
 it derived, it is surprisingly thin, diffuse and romantic

 dinner on the eve of the battle of Aboukir Bay, could
 wipe his mouth and predict, &ldquo;Before this time tomorrow I
 shall have gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey.&rdquo; His
 estimate was exact, being based on the realities of British
 society. The battle was won, and the victor duly dubbed
 Baron Nelson of the Nile. More than that, Parliament
 gave him a pension of two thousand pounds a year, the East
 India Company a bonus of ten thousand pounds; the King
 of Naples conferred a dukedom with an annual income
 valued at three thousand pounds; and he acquired &mdash;tn
 Lady Hamilton &mdash; a voluptuous mistress. After he was
 killed at Trafalgar, it is true that Nelson missed interment
 at Westminster; however, he was buried instead with
equivalent glory in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.

 his soldierly endeavors, required to combine caution, am-

 harassed through the same causes while Chief Executive,

 America more than a century and a half to yield this concession, though
 pot quite as long to look after their windows.
