58 GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 In other words, he did everything feasible to win pre-
 ferment (he rode all the way to Boston in 1756, to estab-
 lish with the commander in chief his precedence over
 Captain Dagworthy) &mdash; everything, that is, short of dis-
 honor. There is something unlikable about the George
Washington of 1753-1758. He seems a trifle raw and
 strident, too much on his dignity, too ready to complain,
 too nakedly concerned with promotion. Yet he had real
 grievances; he was efficient and resolute. His fault lay in
 saving so too frequently to other people, and in nearly
 developing a perecution complex as his hopes faded after
 a promising, amost sensational early start. &lsquo;&rsquo;I have long
 been convinced,&rsquo;&rsquo; he reiterated to Dinwiddie in October
 1757,.&lsquo;&rsquo;that my actions and their motives have been mali-
 ciously aggravated.&rsquo;&rsquo; He had yet to learn the wisdom of
 patience; or rather, he was learning it in a painful school.
 otherwise, his shortcomings were more than balanced
 by his good qualities. His outlook was rather narrowly
 Virginian. He did not conceive of the war as a whole;
 when Forbes chose the Raystown route in 1758, Washing-
 ton&rsquo;s hostility persisted close to the point of insubordina-

 vania &lsquo;&rsquo;artifice,&rsquo;&rsquo; by which the rival colony would get itself
 a road into the back country and so steal the trade of the
 Ohio frontier. It did not seem to occur to him that his
 own attitude might be construed as a Virginia &lsquo;&ldquo;artifice.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;but at any rate he was loyal to Virginia. What he wanted,
ideally, was a regular commission to defend Virginia. If
 he had wanted a royal commission on any terms, he could
 have purchased one, as young Bryan Fairfax did.
 With the longing for preferment went the thirst for
