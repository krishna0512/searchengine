194  GEORGE WASHINGTON ,MAN AND MONUMENT

 ness for the inevitable.
 As for ambition &mdash;gloria &mdash; it is conceived as a civic im-
 pulse, not a private torment. Certainly this is true of Wash-
 ington once he had got over his young man&rsquo;s hunger for
 notice and preferment. Again, Washington&rsquo;s desire to be
 well thought of and to keep his reputation unsullied is a
 classical desire, not in the least akin to the populist,

 of the present day so susceptible to the idea of public

 the tumult over Jay&rsquo;s treaty, he acted in the manner of a
 high-minded Roman, unhesitating. He spoke of &lsquo;&rsquo;the Peo-

 It would be idle to pretend that Washington&rsquo;s Virginia
 simply repeated the modes and experiences of the ancient
 world, or that all his contemporaries were as &ldquo;markedly
 &ldquo;classical&rsquo;&rsquo; in temperament. The point is that his age dif-
 fered profoundly from ours; that in certain ways he is
 better understood within a classical framework than as a
 man of modern times; and that his planter Virginia was
 in a way more truly &ldquo;Roman&rsquo;&rsquo; than the mother country.
 Tha image of Rome sketched here is an ideal one. More

severely practical; and this is the impression we finally re-
 tain of Washington&rsquo;s chatacter &mdash;a type of character that
 is unfamiliar to our generation. tn historial terms the
