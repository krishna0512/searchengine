24      GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 selves that these things were hidden from Washington.
 Looking back on the events of Washington&rsquo;s life, some of
 his panegyrists have discovered Providence busily at work.
 Here and here, they say, are proofs that it was all fore-
 ordained; so shapely and illustrious an outcome must have
 been. Washington himself frequently spoke of destiny,
 and committed himself to it. But he did so in no Napole-
 onic mood. He never felt that he was the Man of Destiny,
 only that what would be would be. When he ventured to
 predict, he usually did so by way of warning: such or such
 would be the melancholy consequences, if Americans failed
 to guard against them. If he seemed to walk confidently, he
 walked into the dark, without benefit of second sight &mdash;a
 mortal man in an ennobling but bewildering time, for
 whom tomorrow was a problem and next year an enigma.
 This is what we must at all costs remember about him. In
 his own eyes, history happened to him, not the other way
 round. He did what he could.
