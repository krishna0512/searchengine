108 GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN AND MONUMENT
 troubles, since they expected high tank. But some &mdash;
 notably Thaddeus Kosciusko, the eager young Marquis de
 Lafayette, Baron de Kalb and &lsquo;&lsquo;Baron&rsquo;&rdquo; von Steuben (of
 spurious nobility but a genuine soldier) &mdash; were of great
 value to the American cause. On the news of Saratoga, the
 French decided to do much mote. T&rsquo;heir decision was not
 based on sentiment, though they admired the courage of
 the colonies and the firmness of Washington, the com-
 mander in chief. It rested on a hardheaded estimate of
 America&rsquo;s chances and &mdash;above all &mdash; on the prospect of
 weakening Britain. Hence the readiness, which France&rsquo;s
 ally Spain deplored, of a despotic monarchy to come to the
 aid of a struggling republic. In a letter sent at the end of
 February 1778, Franklin was able to announce that &lsquo;&rsquo;the
 most Christian king agrees to make a common cause with
 the United States... land) guarantees their liberty, sov-
-ereignty, and independence, absolute and unlimited.&rsquo;&rsquo; By
 midsummer France was officially at war with England.
 Spain followed suit a year later, though she would not go
 as tar as the French in recognizing the United States as a
 separate nation.
 Washington heard of the treaty in April. &lsquo;&lsquo;T believe no
 event,&rsquo;&rsquo; he wrote to Congress, &lsquo;&ldquo;was ever received with more
 heartfelt joy,&rsquo;&rsquo; and no one was mote relieved than himself.
 Oddly enough, the weeks during which the alliance was
 being formulated were among the worst in Washington&rsquo;s
 whole life. To the physical misery of the log huts at Valley
 Forge was added a good deal of mental anguish, for this
was the period of the so-called Conway Cabal&mdash; a plot to
 oust Washington from the supreme command in favor of
 Horatio gates.
