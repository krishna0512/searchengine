GENERAL WASHINGTON                                            119
De Grasse and marched off toward Virginia. For the first
 time since Dorchester Heights, everything went smoothly
 for him, as though all the participants hat rehearsed be-
 forehand. De Grasse reached the jaws of Chesapeake Bay
 just ahead of a British squadron, sealing off Cornwallis&rsquo;s
 seaward exit. Within a few days Washington, Rochambeau,
 Lafayette and De Grasse converged and met. Seventeen
 thousand allied troops (eight thousand of them French)
 surrounded Yorktown, and for the moment the French held
 naval supremacy. It was a miracle made actual. It was even
 being enacted in Washington&rsquo;s own setting; only a few
 miles away was Williamsburg, where half a lifetime ago
 he had ridden back from the Ohio country to warn Din-
 widdie of the encroachments of the fleur-de-lis. In Sep-
 tember and October 1781 he was well content to have the
 fleur-de-lis ranged alongside the &ldquo;thirteen stripes alternate
 red and white,&rdquo; the &ldquo;thirteen stars white in a blue field.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 His Continentals strove to emulate the professionalism
 of the French: days of punctilio to round off the tatter-
 demalion years. Allied guns and mortars hammered the
 town. Outnumbered by two to one, and thwarted by a
 storm in an attempt to escape across the York River to
 Gloucester Point, Cornwallis lost heart. With an anguish
 that may be imagined, he sent a brief note to Washington
 on October 17 &mdash; the third anniversary of Saratoga:
SIR,
     I propose a cessation of hostilities for twenty-four
 hours, and that two officers may be appointed by each
 side ....to settle terms for the surrender of the posts at
York and Gloucester.
                       I have the honour to be, &amp;c
                                                             CORNWALLIS
