80 GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT 
 Washington had written to Sally  Fairfax that he would
 dearly like to play Juba to her Marcia, in Addison&rsquo;s Cato,
 Marcia was Cato&rsquo;s daughter, and Juba was a Numidian
 princeling, one of Cato&rsquo;s supporters. That theatrical dream
 belonged to the buried past; sally Fairfax had sailed for
 England with her husband in 1773, and was never to return

 of not far short of fifteen thousand militia. Inside Boston
 was less than half that number of British troops, who a
 fortnight earlier had lost a thousand men in their expen-

 Gage, had led Braddock&rsquo;s ill-fated advance guard twenty
 years before, when Washington was a junior aide-de-camp.
 At the time, however, such consolations were dwarfed by
 a mass of problems. There was the wrench of leaving
 Martha and his cherished Virginia estates. There were all
 the worries of command. Many of the New Englanders
 were suspicious of Washington, and he was suspicious of
 many of them &mdash; as he revealed in some indiscreet corre-
 apondence. He complained that &ldquo;Order, Regularity and
