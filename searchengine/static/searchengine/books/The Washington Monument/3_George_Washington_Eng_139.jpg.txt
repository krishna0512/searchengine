124     GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 erred as a soldier, it was on the side of rashness; knowing
 this, with the deep self-knowledge that he somehow ex-
 pected others to share, he was incensed by the imputation
 of timidity. Others might talk of Fabian tactics, even ap-
 provingly; he himself seems never to have invoked the
 name of Fabius Cunctator, the Delayer.
 He was not a perfect soldier, then; yet in Washington
 was discovered someone who came near to meeting an im-
 possible list of requirements. Congress wanted first a com-
 mander in chief who would confer luster upon their cause.
 This Washington did with a polish that impressed even
 hostile Englishmen like Howe, not to mention a sympa-
 thetic Englishman such as Chatham, who informed the
 House of Lords (in February 1777), &ldquo;America... is not
 a wild and lawless banditti, who having nothing to lose,
 might hope to snatch something from public convulsions;
 many of their leaders... have a great stake in this great
 contest: &mdash; the gentleman who conducts their armies, I am
 told, has an estate of four or five thouand pounds a
 year.&rdquo; Even more important was the impression that
 Washington made upon the French. Perhaps he laid him-
 self out to please them; if so, he succeeded to an astonish-
 ing degree. To nearly all he was a veritable Chevalier
 Bayard, sans Peur et sans reproche. Here, they agreed, was
 a gentleman of quite unusual poise and integrity.
 Next, Congress wanted a commander who could raise
 and direct an army on the European model, fit to
encounter professionals &mdash; a genuine Continental army,
 worthy of the United States. This was Washington&rsquo;s own
 overriding passion; to procure &ldquo;Order, Regularity and
 &ldquo;My italics.
