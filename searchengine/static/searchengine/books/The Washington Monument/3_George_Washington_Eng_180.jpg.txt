 devastating &mdash; challenge at the national level to the Feder-
 alist Gazette of the United States, which had come into
 existence with the new government in 1789, under the ed-
 itorship of John Fenno, and which unfailingly supported
 Hamilton. Fenno&rsquo;;s rival editor, the poet Philip Freneau,

 of &lsquo;&ldquo;parties.&rsquo;&rdquo; Only in a rough and undefined sense were
 the programs of the executive heads taken to be those of
 the President himself, still less of a unanimous Administra-
