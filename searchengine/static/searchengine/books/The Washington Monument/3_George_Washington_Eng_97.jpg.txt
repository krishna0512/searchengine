 his subordinates. It so, his hesitations are understandable
 in view of &ldquo;the limited and contracted knowledge, which
 any of us have in military matters.&rsquo; Even Charles Lee,
 despite his conversational flow, had had no practical ex.
 perience in maneuvering large formations. Washington&rsquo;s
