112 GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN  AND MONUMENT 
Simply that he revealed again, as conspicuously as at Tren-
 ton or Germantown, his personal courage under fire. It was
 that &mdash; aganist the advice of his council of war &mdash;he tried
 to bring on a major battle. His motive may have been quite
 practical, since he suspected that the New Jersey militia
 would desert him (which they did immediately after ward)
 to go and gather in their crops. Or he may have felt that
 the American morale &lsquo;&ldquo;stood in need of something to keep

 with their old enemy, and with Spain, their naval suprem-
 acy was challenged; thus, they could not prevent a French
 fleet under the Comte d&rsquo;Estaing from sailing for America
 in 1778. Elsewhere they were hard pressed &mdash; in the Medi-
 terranean, where Gibraltar was besieged, in the West In-
 dies, and as far away as the Indian Ocean. They had to face
 the possibility (though it never matured) of a Franco-
 Spanish invasion of Britain. In December 1780 Holland
 joined Britain&rsquo;s enemies; and in the same year, led by
Russia, a number of European countries demonstrated
 their hostility by banding together in a League of Armed
 Neutrality.
 In retrospect again, we can see Valley Forge as the nadir
 of the American effort. Henceforward, Washington&rsquo;s pri-
 macy as military leader was unquestioned. The third and
 final hope of rounding him lay with Howe at German town
 and Brandy wine &mdash; or perhaps in a sudden midwinter as-
 sault upon Valley Forge. When Howe settled for minor
