10         GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
tice so shocking!shocking even in slaves and dogs; then how
 utterly scandalous in little boys at school, who ought to look
 on one another as brothers"); young Washington throw-
 ing a stone across the Rappahannock (It would be no easy
matter to find a man, now-a-days, who could do it); Wash-
 ington's providential escape at Braddock&rsquo;s defeat (A famous
 Indian warrior, who acted a leading part in that bloody
 tragedy, was often heard to swear, that &ldquo;Washington was
 not born to be killed by a bullet! For... I had seventeen
 fair fires at him with my rifle, and after all could not bring
 him to the ground!"); Washington discovered &mdash; by a
 Quaker "of the respectable family and name of Potts, if
 I mistake not&rdquo; &mdash;praying at Valley Forge (As he ap-
proached the spot... whom should he behold... but
 the commander in chief of the American armies on his
knees at prayer!); and so on.
 All through the book, as unremittingly as Horatio Alger
 was to thump home the message, Weems showed how "duty
 and advantage&rdquo; went together. Thus, kindness to his elder
 brother brought George the Mount Vernon estate when
 this brother died childless save for one ailing infant; and
 exemplary conduct subsequently won him the hand of the
 widow Custis, whose "Wealth was equal, at least, to one
 hundred thousand dollars!&rdquo; The homily was irresistible;
 by 1825 Weems&rsquo;s biography had gone through forty edi-
 tions, and forty more were to appear in due course. The
 cherry-tree story &mdash; eventually incorporated in McGuffey&rsquo;s
highly popular Readers &mdash; became a special favorite in
 copybook lore. Invention was even added to invention in
 Morrison Heady&rsquo;s little life of Washington, The Farmer
Boy, and How He Became commander-in-chief (1863).
