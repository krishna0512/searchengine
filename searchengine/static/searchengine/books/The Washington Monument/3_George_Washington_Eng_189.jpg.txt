174   GEORGE   WASHINGTON, MAN AND  MONUMENT&rdquo;
 &lsquo;Treaty was an American rather than a Federalist measure.
 Such was the Republican view of foreign policy in
Washington&rsquo;s second administration. At home they de-
-tected other evidence of federalist malice. Hamilton&rsquo;s
 &ldquo;odious&rdquo; excise law (as Jefferson called it) provoked so
 much indignation that in 1792 Washington tried to rein-
 force it in a severely worded proclamation. Two years
 later, persuaded by Hamilton that the &rsquo;&rsquo;whiskey rebels&rdquo; of
 western Pennsylvania were threatening the safety of the
 Union, he called one a large militia force and sent it to the
 scene of the trouble, after inspecting the troops at their
 rendezvous. There was no fighting because &mdash; according to
 the Republicans &mdash; there was no real rebellion, only a
 phantom conjured up by Hamilton for his own purposes. A
 hundred and fifty Pennsylvanians were arrested; two were
 condemned to death. Washington pardoned them, yet he
 seemed to be converted to Hamilton&rsquo;s views. The game, in
 Madison&rsquo;s opinion, was &lsquo;to connect the Democratic Societies
 with the odium of the insurrection &mdash;to connect the
republicans in Congress with those societies &mdash; to put the
president ostensibly at the head of the other party.&rsquo;&rdquo; Jeffer-
 son, a car earlier, had actually told the President that
 Hamilton&rsquo;s intention was &ldquo;to dismount him from being the
 head of the nation and to make him the head of a patty.&rdquo;
 When Washington went so far as to lay the blame for the
 rebellion on &lsquo;&ldquo;certain self - created societies,&rsquo; in his annual
 address to Congress of November gt, Madison thought
 he had made &lsquo;&rsquo;perhaps the greatest error of his political
life."".
so much for the republican interpretation of events.
 What of Washington&rsquo;s standpoint Re was neither Anglo.
