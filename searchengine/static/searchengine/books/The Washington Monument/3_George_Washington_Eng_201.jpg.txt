186  GEORGE WASHINGTIN , MAN AND MONUMENT 
Grappling with the problem, some biographers  have
 solved it by denying that it exists; by stressing, that is, the
 &lsquo;&lsquo;human&rdquo; qualities of the man. Thus, to Bradley T. John-
 son "Washington was a man all over &mdash; a man with strong
 appetites, fierce temper, positive, belligerent, and aggres-
 sive&rsquo;; Rupert Hughes maintains that Washington was ac-
 tually &lsquo;&ldquo;one of the most eager, versatile, human men that
 ever lived&rsquo;&rsquo;; to Saul K. Padover he is a &lsquo;&rsquo;passionate, sensi-
 ive, earthy, deeply feeling human being; and to Howard
 Swiggett, in a book entitled The Great Man:  George
 Washington a; a Human Being (1953), it; hero is a com-
 pound of "magnetism and grandeur, cold fury and biting
 wit, goodness and charity, troubles and woe... believ-
 ing in dignity and decorum but able to laugh at or discard
 them.&rsquo;&rsquo; This is the approach that dwells on his reckless cour-
 age; or upon his eloqgent swearing at Manmouth Coutrt
 House, that day of intolerable heat and vexation when he
 is supposed to have called Charles Lee a "damned pol-
kroon&rsquo;&rsquo;; or upon his popularity with women, his fondness
 for dancing and so on.
 The emphasis is not without value. It provides a useful
 corrective to the genuflections of early biographers   like 
 Marshall, Weems and Sparks. We can do without the
 absurder items in the Washington legend &mdash; the cherry
 tree, the prayer at Valley Forge and  the rest. It is espe-
 cially important in going behind the Washington of the
 Stuart portrait to the younger and far less eminent man,
 the valnerable adolescent, the energetic surveyor, the busy
 colonel of Virginia militia, the planter in love with his
new estates
