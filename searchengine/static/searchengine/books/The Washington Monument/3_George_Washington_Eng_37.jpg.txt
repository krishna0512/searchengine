22 GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 strangers like Mr. Nelson Rockefeller and Mr. Wellington
 Koo. Napoleon Bonaparte is a still more formidable figure
 to posterity. The subject of literaliy thousands of books
 (three or four times as many as Washington, one would
 guess), he is perpetuated also in a network of highways, a
 coinage, a legal system &mdash; in short, in the entire fabric of his
 nation, not to mention other European countries.
 Nevertheless, there is probably nothing quite like the
Washington Monument in history. There have been vari-
 ous conceptions of him, and they have altered somewhat                   from generation to generation. But none of the principal
 conceptions &mdash;the sides of the monument &mdash; has been
 wildly at variance with the others, and none has been dis-
 credited. Could anyone who weighed his words soberly say
 this, as Gladstone did of Washington, about any other
 celebrity of Washington&rsquo;s time or since?
 If, among all the pedestals supplied by history for pub-
 lic characters of extraordinary nobility and purity, I saw
 one higher than all the rest, and if I were required, at a
 moment&rsquo;s notice, to name the fittest occupant for it, I
 think my choice, at any time during the last forty-five
years, would have lighted, and it would now light upon
 Washington.
 Surely no one else has been so thoroughly venerated, and
 so completely frozen into legend. The name Napolean may
 evoke a picture of a brilliant general, a ruthless tyrant, a
 restless exile, or perhaps a faithless husband. But the pic-
 ture, however grand or highly colored, is credible; it is of a
 recognizable man. The same is emphatically true of the
 name Nelson, which at once conjures up images of a dash-
ing public career and a gaudy private one. It is even true of
