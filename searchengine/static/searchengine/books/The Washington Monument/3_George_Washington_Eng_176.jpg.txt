 gress. Finally, the other chief executive head, Thomas
 Jefferson, did not take office until six months after Hamil-
 ton &mdash; six vital months during which Hamilton&rsquo;s advice
 was constantly sought on all major problems, including
 foreign policy, and unfailingly given.
 The consequences were almost catastrophic, since Jef-

 adopted; and they now seem such commonplaces of Amer-
