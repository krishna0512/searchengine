162     GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 ica&rsquo;s heritage that it takes an imaginative effort to see why
 they stirred up so much protest.
 The main reason is, of course, that Hamilton&rsquo;s proposals
 appealed strongly to the conservative and mercantile ele-
 ments in the Union and were correspondingly antipathetic
 to other, radical and agrarian groups. It was difficult in
 the circumstances to arrive at any compromise; one set
 of interests or the others was hound to be dissatisfied. The
 initial problem, which Hamilton tackled in 1790, was that
 of America&rsquo;s debts. These, which had been incurred dur-
 ing the evolutionary War, amounted to about eighty
 million dollars, of which twenty-five million were owed by
 individual states. Hamilton proposed to honor them in full,
 though the paper securities which represented the various
 debts were greatly depreciated. He proposed, that is, to
 fund the national debt at face value and to assume the
 state debts as a national liability, almost at par. Hamilton
 won the debate, basing his case on national honor and
 national confidence &mdash; both arguments that seemed sound
 to Washington. The arguments against funding and as-
 sumption were varied; but perhaps the most heated was
 that of Hamilton&rsquo;s scheme to enrich the speculator: the
 usual holder of paper securities was not the original owner,
 who had bought them for patriotic reasons and sold them
 through necessity at a discount, but the crafty Easterner
 who was thereby subsidized by the Federal Government.
 Hamilton himself was well aware of the process, but
 he saw its implications in a different light. His measures
 would (he rightly predicted) &ldquo;cement&rdquo; the Union by
 attaching to it every group that acquired a financial stake
 in its well-being.
