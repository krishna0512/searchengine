Potomac. &lsquo;The frontier was on the move; indeed, an even
 more ambitious development scheme &mdash; the Loyal Com-
-pany &mdash; was initiated by another group of venturers at the
 same time.
The  connection between these grandiose territorial
 projects and the first career of young Washington is ob-
 vious. Land was important; Washington became a sur-
 veyor. Perhaps Lawrence was partly responsible; if he was
 kind to George, he did not train him to be a dandy. Law-

 was not an elegant career or (as George&rsquo;s uncle pointed
 out) one with much chance of &lsquo;&rsquo;preferment.&rsquo;&rdquo; Still, there
 is no need to find elaborate explanations. Probably every
 Virginia planter learned something about surveying, and
 was taught as a boy &mdash; as George was &mdash; how to draft a

 When George was sixteen he knew enough about sur-

 he accompanied a Fairfax party to the Shenandoah coun-

 was employed as assistant surveyor in laying out the new
 town of Belhaven (rechristened Alexandria) on the Po-

 George was launching himself under family auspices. Soon
 after, he was appointed surveyor of Culpeper County. And
how, on a modest scale, his career advanced briskly as he
 carried oat surveys throughout the newer areas of northern
 Virginia. By the end of 1750 the eighteen-year-old surveyor
 had even managed to lay claim on his own behalf to three
 tracts &mdash; of 1450 acres altogether &mdash; in the lower Shenan-
