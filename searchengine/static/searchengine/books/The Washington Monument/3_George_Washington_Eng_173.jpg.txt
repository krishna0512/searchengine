158 GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN AND MONUMENT
 ntzed, before he became President, that &mdash; in addition to
 the usual provincial rivalries &mdash; the country was seriously
 divided over the new Constitution. He thought it quite
likely that the Anti-Federalists would vote against him in
 the electoral college.
Washington and many other; with him were dismayed
 to find that the adoption of the Constitution focused argu-
 ment rather than ended it. In general, those who had
 actively supported the Constitution in 1787-1788 were
 ranged against those who had had misgivings. They con-
 tinged to cal] themselves Federalists and Anti-Federal-
 ists, and to quarrel noisily over the desired shape of their
 infant nation. There was no neat division. Some men,
 such as Madison and Randolph, changed their minds.
 Differences of opinion were met within the same family;
Fisher Ames of Massachusetts, the Federalists&rsquo; most elo-
 quent champion in the House of Representatives, had no
 fiercer enemy than his own brother Nathaniel, who even
 refused to attend Fisher&rsquo;s funeral some years later &mdash;al-
 leging that it was being staged as a piece of Federalist
propaganda. Roughly, though, the Federalists (the &lsquo;&lsquo;prig-
 archy.&rsquo;&rdquo; in Nathaniel Ames&rsquo;s view) were men of sub-
 stance: merchants, lawyers and the like, Easterners, for
 the most part. Their opponents ("mobocrats,&rdquo; as against
"monocrats,&rsquo;&rsquo; in the terminology of the tine) were in
 opposition for various reasons. Some still disliked the idea
 of a  strong national government, or even the principle
 of administrative authority. Government, for them as for
 Tom Paine, was &ldquo;the lost badge of innocence.&rsquo;&rdquo; Others,
especially in the West and South, objected to the Federal-
 ists as a clique of selfish  businessmen.
