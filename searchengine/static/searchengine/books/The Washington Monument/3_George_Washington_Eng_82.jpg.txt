GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQUIRE                             67
 first was the removal (thanks to the victorious war of 1756-
 1763) ot the French threat. By the peace of 1763 France
 gave up all her possessions in North America. Once her
 power was ended, so in great measure was colonial de-
 pendence upon the mother country. The second cause,
 which followed logically from the first, was the attempt of
 Britain to reorganize her colonial empire. Some degree of
 reorganization was inevitable, since Britain had conquered
 the Canadian provinces. To colonials it also appeared that
 Britain had inherited French conceptions of empire in the
 back country between the Alleghenies and the Mississippi,
 by reserving the area for Indians and fur traders. Such
 seemed to be the motive behind the Proclamation of 1763,
 which forbade white settlement beyond the Allegheny
 watershed, while the Quebec Act ot 1774 designated as
 Canadian territory all land north of the Ohio River. In
 the intervening years the mother country had tried to cre-
 ate a more systematic imperiat structure, embracing the
 older as well as the newly won dominions. The seaboatd
 colonies were now required to pay their share of the costs
 of empire, through taxes that would also define more
 sharply the mercantilist pattern, according to which the
 colonies supplied raw materials to Britain and provided
 a market for Britain&rsquo;s manufactures. The proposed taxes
 were not burdensome in themselves; the colonies as a whole
 were prosperous and under lighter fiscal burdens than the
 mother country.
What irked the American colonies &mdash;and here we come
 to the third cause &mdash; was the assumption that they were
 not parts of Britain but possessions of Britain. In actuality
 they were mature, or nearly so, in modes of life and in
