GENERAL WASHINGTON                                        95
 must be restored to his realm, by force if reason failed &mdash;
 the iron hand in the velvet glove. But as the war dragged
 on, it seemed that the figure should be changed; what the
 British proffered was a mailed fist with a flabby hand within
 it. They held military and naval supremacy, yet seemed un-
 able or unwilling to use it decisively. It would be inaccu-
 rate to portray General Gage and his successors as a group
 of tender-hearted well-wishers, though neither were they
 (not poor melancholy, conscientious George III) the super-
 cilious monsters depicted in patriot propaganda. Their
 original mistake lay rather in despising than in secretly ad-
 miring the American colonists. &lsquo;&ldquo;They are raw, undis-
 ciplined, cowardly men,&rsquo;&rsquo; declared Lord Sandwich in a
 much-publicized taunt; and Gage&rsquo;s frontal assault at
 Bunker Hill showed that he shared Sandwich&rsquo;s opinion &mdash;
 though not when the battle was over. Sir William Howe
 (he was knighted for having won at Long Island) was less
 sanguine, but he also conducted operations in 1776 with a
 degree of disdain.
 To some extent, though, his hesitations are explicable
 in terms ot scruple. We may perhaps discount the fact that
 Gage had an American wife, that Clinton&rsquo;s father had been
 colonial governor of New York, that Howe&rsquo;s elder brother
 (killed at Ticonderoga in 1758, fighting the French) had
 been a hero in the colonies.
 But we cannot overlook the fatal ambiguity of their en-
 deavors. It is well summarized in the situation of the Howe
brothers, who, when they came to New York to wage war
 on the rebels, in all the panoply of destruction, came also
 as peace commissioners, officially empowered by George
 III to discuss an &ldquo;accommodation.&rdquo; After General Howe&rsquo;s
