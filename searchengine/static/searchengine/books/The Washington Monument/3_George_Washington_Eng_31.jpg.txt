16      GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
The Disinterested Patriot
 AS FATHER of His People, Washington of course stands
 apart&mdash; though perhaps conceding a lesser share to Ben-
 jamin Franklin. ("The history of or Revolution,&rdquo; wrote
 the exasperated John Adams, &ldquo;will be one continued lie
 from one end to the other. The essence of the whole will be
 that Dr. Franklin&rsquo;s electric rod smote the earth and out
 sprang General Washington. That Franklin electrified him
 with his rod, and thenceforward these two conducted all the
 policy negotiations, legislatures, and war.") As Disinterested
 Patriot, he is one of a select pantheon. Against nearly all his-
 torical precedent he retired to private life twice, after hold-
 ing the two most powerful offices in America. Marveling at
 such humility, men could only compare him with Timo-
 leon of Corinth, who brought peace to Sicily and lived out
 his days there; with Cincinnatas &mdash;
Thus, when of old, from his paternal farm
Rome bad her rigid Cincinnatus arm,
Th&rsquo; illustrious peasant rushed to the field;
 Soon are the haughty Volsii taught to yield;
 His country sav'd, the solemn triumph o&rsquo;er,
 He tills his native acres as before.
 (these lines, by the Maryland poet Charles Henry Whar-
 ton, are from &lsquo;A Poetical Epistle&rdquo; addressed to Washington
 in 1779); or with the younger Cato of Addison&rsquo;s play (two
 of whose lines &mdash;"Tis not in mortals to command success"
 and &ldquo;The post of honour is a private station&rdquo;&mdash; Washing-
 ton was fond of quoting). They could contrast him with the
