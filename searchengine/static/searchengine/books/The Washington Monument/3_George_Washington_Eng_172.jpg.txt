 lieved- Washington was haughty and impatient, and de-
 parted irritably when the Senate was unwilling to give
 immediate assent to his wishes.
 However, even Maclay admits that when Washington
 came back after the adjournment, he seemed perfectly
 good-humored. If he never repeated the experiment,
