GENERAL WASHINGTON                                121
 and sailed for England. The remainder of the tale, for the
 British forces, was drab; tittle by little they packed their
 bags, evacuated their ports and fortresses and sailed away.
The center of interest had shifted to Paris, where the
 American commissioners &mdash;John Adam, Franktin, Jay
 and Laurens &mdash; were getting an even better bargain than
 they had hoped. The independence of the United States
 was recognized, and her territories were defined as stretch-
 ing from the seaboard to the Mississippi, from the Great
 Lakes to Spanish Florida. This handsome treaty was for-
 mally ratified by Congress in September 1783.
 The war was won, the peace was won. When Washing-
 ton accepted command in June 1775, he had written con-
 solingly to Martha that he expected to "return safe to you
 in the fall." Privately he may have suspected that the call
 to duty would last much longer. He can hardly have sup-
 posed that it would last for eight and a half years. He was
 heartily glad to be homeward bound. But he could not
 make the transition and take &ldquo;my leave of all the employ-
 ments of public life&rdquo; without deep emotion; too mach had
 happened in interim, Saying good-by to his officers at
 Fraunces&rsquo; Tavern in New York, in December 1783, he and
 they were in tears; and when Washington handed back
 his commander in chief&rsquo;s commission to Congress at An-
 napolis a few days later, the significance, the weight of the
 occasion overwhelmed the spectators. There was too much
 to be said &mdash;an almost unbearable sense of history made
 and in the making. It lingered over Washington, in Ameri-
 can minds, as he rode away, hurrying to he at Mount Ver-
 non by Christmas Eve.
