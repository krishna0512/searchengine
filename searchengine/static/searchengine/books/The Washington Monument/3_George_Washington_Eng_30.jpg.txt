THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT                             15
 when (in the 1920s) he burned some letters by Washington
 that had come into his possession, on the ground that they
 were &ldquo;smutty." Hence, likewise, the universal American
 horrow at men like Benedict Arnold, the betrayers of Wash-
 ington and of their fatherland. In committing treason they
 were also guilty of sacrilege.
 Some of his countrymen &mdash;notably John Adams&mdash; were
 a little irked by the Washington cult. They felt that adula-
 tion had gone too far &mdash; as in the suggestion that God had
 denied Washington children of his own so that he might
 assume paternity for the whole action. But even Adams was
 prepared to defend Washington as a native product against
 all challengers from other lands, with the proviso that
Washington&rsquo;s virtues were America&rsquo;s virtues, rather than
 vice versa. Washington was great because his country bred
 such qualities, and shaped their fulfillment. Here, then,
 are two conceptions of Washington the Father of His
 People, as transcendent American and as representative
 American. But in either case he was (as Rufus Griswold
 said) &ldquo;identified with the country&rsquo;&rsquo; to an unparalleled de-
 gree. "He was its mind; it was his image and illustration.&rdquo;
 Certainly this is true in terms of nomenclature. The name
 of Washington, as we have seen, spread all over the land;
 and it was adopted for people as well as places. There was
Washington Irving; one of Walt Whitman&rsquo;s brother; was
 called George Washington Whitman; and for the ex-slave
 boy Booker Taliaferro, to adopt the surname of Washing-
 ton was in a way to take on American citizenship.
