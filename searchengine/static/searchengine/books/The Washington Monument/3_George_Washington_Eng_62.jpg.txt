GEORGE WASHINGTON ,ESQUIRE  47 
gradually deserted by his Indians and harassed by other
 problems, Washington drew his troops into a hastily im-
 provised stockade at Gteat Meadows which he named Fort
 Necessity. On July 3, by which time all his Indians had
 melted away, the French surrounded the fort. Unlike the
 Jumonville skirmish, this fight lasted most of the day, in

 to sign.
 It was a bitter defeat for the young officer. Some thought

 and in general his actions were praised, both at Williams-
 burg and in London. For a comparative youngster he was
 famous; a private letter of his describing the Jumonville
skirmish was reprinted in the London Magazine, and

 ton had written to his brother, adding with youthful en-
 thusiasm, &ldquo;I heard the bullets whistle, and, believe me,
 there is something charming in the sound.&rsquo; According to
 Walpole, King George remarked that Washington &lsquo;&rsquo;would
 not say so, had he heard many.&rsquo; This wry comment was
