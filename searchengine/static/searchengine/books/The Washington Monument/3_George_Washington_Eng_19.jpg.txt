4 GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN AND MONUMENT
 miles away, in the vault of his Mount Vernon home.
 Innumerable tourists visit Mount Vernon. It is a hand-
 some place, as they can testify, refurbished with taste and
 maintained in immaculate order. But the ghosts have been
 all too successfully exorcised in the process; Mount Vernon
 is less a house than a kind of museum-temple. We know
 that George Washington lived and died there; we do not
 feel the fact, any more than we can recapture the presence
 of William Shakespeare at Stratford-on-Avon. Both men
 are baffling figures to us, prodigious and indistinct. One
 American writer has said of them that &ldquo;England&rsquo;s greatest
 contribution to the world is the works of Shakespeare;
 America&rsquo;s is the character of Washington.&rsquo;&rsquo; On this sort of
 scale are they measured; and it is not a human scale.
 There is a diference, of course. Whereas we can find out
 almost nothing about Shakespeare, we have a vast amount
 of information about Washington. Only one blank por-
 trait of Shakespeare exists; the portraits of Washington &mdash;
 some of them apparently excellent likenesses &mdash; require
 three volumes to list in full. There are no autobiographical
fragments from Shakespeare&rsquo;s hand; Washington&rsquo;s letters
 and diaries fill over forty volumes, in printed form. Hardly
 any of his contemporaries mentioned Shakespeare; scores
 of friends, acquaintances and casual callers set down for us
 their impressions of George Washington. A strange obacu-
 tity envelops the figure of Shakespeare; Washington stood
 in the glaring limelight of world fame. But the result
 &mdash; optically, so to speak &mdash; is similar: the darkness and the
 dazzle both have an effect of concealment.
 Trying in vain to discern the actual man behind the
 huge; impersonal, ever-growing legend, biographers have
