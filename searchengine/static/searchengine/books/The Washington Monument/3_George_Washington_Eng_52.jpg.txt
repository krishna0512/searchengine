GEORGE WASHINGTON , ESQUIRE          37
 was exceptionaly awkward in drawing-room encounters.
 Perhaps he was a little heavy and humorless, as well as
 immature; was he such different from hia local rivals? we
 can only guess at the truth.
 A related and more tantalizing conundrum is offered by
 Sarah Sally) Cary, the daughter of Colonel Wilson Cary,
