PRESIDENT WASHINGTON 141 
 mitted themselves (though also warily), who took the lead
 in the move for a new government. They wanted to en-
 list his aid not for his pen or his brain bat for his name. To
 Americans, Washington was victory, rectitude &mdash; and, for
 the moment, something of a cipher. Surely, Jay told him
 in Match 1786, he could not watch the disintegration of
 America &ldquo;with the eye of an unconcerned spectator&rdquo;?
 Sounding him out, Jay went on &ldquo;An opinion begins to
 prevail, that a General Convention for revising the articles
 of Confederation would be expedient.&rsquo;&rsquo; Replying, a month
 later, Washington agreed broadly that the &lsquo;&lsquo;fabrick&rsquo;&rsquo; was
 &lsquo;&lsquo;tottering&rdquo;; but he confined himself to cautious generali-
 ties.
 Again, this is not to accuse Washington of stupidity or
 irresponsibility, but merely to emphasize that he had no
 ready solution to offer. Viewed as an agglomeration of
 farmers and merchants, America was prospering. Con-
 gress was not entirely inept; it was the legitimate govern-
 ment of the land. It Congress were not willing to reform
 itself, could reform be legally imposed by some ad hoc
 convention? What would people say? What would the
 states say? On the other hand, the Articles of Confedera-
 tion, in practice, did not admit of firm national govern-
 ment; the states were dangerously indifferent to Congress
 and antagonistic to one another. Something should be
 done.
 Following some way behind the active controversialists,
 as he had done before 1775, Washington gradually began
 to sort out his ideas. Thus on August 1, 1786, he wrote
 three letters. Two went to France, to the Chevalier de la
 Luzerne and the American minister, Thomas Jefferson.
