GENERAL WASHINGTON                                         117
 over five thousand American defenders. Clinton returned
 to New York, leaving Cornwallis with eight thousand men
 to hold Georgia and South Carolina as a loyalist bastion.
Washington, compelled to remain on the Hudson and
 watch Clinton, did what he could by dispatching all the
 troops he could spare to the South; and Congress sent
 Horatio Gates to take command there.
 Now at last the struggle quickened dramatically in
 tempo. Over thousands of miles the main actors, unwritting,
 began to make the moves that would draw them all together
 for the final act. The lesser protagonists, deservedly or not,
 were shouldered aside as irrelevant. Some had been promi-
 nent hitherto &mdash; Gates, for example. But he was heavily
 defeated by Cornwallis at Camden, South Carolina, in
 August 1780, and was superseded within three months. Out,
 too, goes the worthy Baron de Kalb, mortally wounded at
 Camden. Charles Lee is already relegated to the wings.
 Clinton, fretting but immobile in New York, has few more
 lines to say &mdash; a &ldquo;shy bitch,&rsquo;&rsquo; as he diagnosed himself, he
 is not one of history&rsquo;s lucky generals.
 The remaining cast is headed by five figures, with others
 (Greene, Steuben and so on) in subsidiary roles. The five
 are Cornwallis, Lafayette, Washington and two latecomers
 &mdash; the Comte de Rochambeau and Admiral de Grasse.
 Cornwallis brought on the denouement through his win-
 ter campaign of 1780-1781. Ironically, it was a very able
 campaign. He was swift, he was resourceful, and he adapted
 his tactics to American conditions. He and his associate,
 the cavalry leader Banastre Tarleton, humbled Gates at
 Camden and struck hard at Greene (in March 1781, at
 Guilford Court House). Yet Cornwallis writ in water.
