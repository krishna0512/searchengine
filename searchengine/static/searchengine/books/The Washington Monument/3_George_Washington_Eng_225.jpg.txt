210 GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN AND MONUMENT
 with all too few precedents to guide him (though exalted,
 as American leaders often are, by the inordinate severity
 of the task); a sort of splendid foundling at the head of a
 foundling nation, who survives the ordeal by meeting it
 with the maximum of cool dignity and the minimum of
 ideology or introspection. Nelson&rsquo;s recompense is hand-
 some and actual, Washington&rsquo;s mainly metaphorical. No
 glittering stars upon his breast &mdash; many of his countrymen
 felt that it would be indiscreet, to say the least, to wear
 even the order of the Cincinnati. No majesty of address &mdash;
 the one is Viscount Nelson, Duke of Bronte; the other,
 plain Mr. President. He has a coat of arms painted on his
 coach, but that would be judged a ridiculous affectation
 in later Presidents. His head is not to appear on the coin-
 age until he is safely dead. No doubt these were wise
 prejudices, as Washington well comprehended, for a young
republic to express. No doubt it was for the best that execu-
 tive office should be made as unattractive as possible,
 men being the greedy, ambitious creatures that they are.
 But how spare and ungenial it sounds. Or how niggardly;
 Congress took until 1860 to commission and unveil the
 equestrian statue voted him in 1783; and the giant monu-
 ment in Washington, D.C., was not finished and dedicated
 &mdash; the culmination of decades of squabbling &mdash; until 1885,
 nearly fourscore and seven years after the demise of the
 man it commemorates.?
 Think of Mount Vernon &mdash; sun cracking its tired soil,
rain eating gullies in the fields around the mansion, hot
 &ldquo;His mother&rsquo;s grave at Fredericksburg, where she died tn 1789, was un-
 marked by any memorial until 1833. The fifty-foot obelisk then planned
 was not completed until 1894!.
