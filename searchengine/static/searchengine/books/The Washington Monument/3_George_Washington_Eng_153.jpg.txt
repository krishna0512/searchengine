138 GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN AND MONUMENT
those days he achieved a measure of distinction, but he
 did not tin the eyes of his contemporaries, at any rate)
 achieve true greatness. That he accomplished tn the war
itself. In retirement afterwards, he was a factor in the
 national scene; whatever he did tended to have national
 repercussions, and whatever he did rot do was also,
 negatively, a factor of national importance. Washington
 was well aware of this; and even if he had not been, his
 experience as president-general of the Cincinnati was
 well calculated to ram home the lesson.
The problem in considering Washington&rsquo;s development
 between 1783 and 1789 is this did he achieve further
 greatness in his own right, or was further greatness thrust
 upon him, as something he could not avoid? Did he take
 a lead in re-forming the Union, or was he merely brought
 in, so to speak, in an honorary capacity? Or does the
 truth lie somewhere between such extremes ? And behind
 this problem is another one, which still engages histo-
rians in vehement debate: what was the actual state of
 the Union during the years of the Confederation? Was
 this &lsquo;&ldquo;the critical period,&rsquo; or was America in fact flour-
 ishing ? Did the United States really need a new in-
-strument of government? And (to come back to our hero)
 did Washington himself genuinely believe that the Union
 was in danger? If so, did ha make ap his own mind, or
 did others plant the notion?
perhaps no final answers to such questions are possible.
but they are worth raising, to shake our minds tree of the
 conventional, oversimplified picture of George Washing-
 ton &mdash; even if we end up with explanations not wildly dis-
 similar to the usual ones.
