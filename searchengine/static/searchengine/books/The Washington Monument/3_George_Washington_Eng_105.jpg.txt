90    GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 had had the forethought to collect up and down the river,
 there was nothing to stop the British from marching in
 strength upon Philadelphia. Morale in the middle colonies
 was understandably low, and not improved when Congress
 &mdash; acting upon advice from Generals Israel Putnam and
 Thomas Mifflin &mdash; withdrew from Philadelphia to Balti-
 more. Charles Lee in a careless reconnaissance was taken
 prisoner by a British patrol. The militia were deserting in
 numbers, and the Continental enlistments were about to
 expire.
 But somehow the crisis was averted. Howe called of
 large-scale operations for the winter and dispatched six
 thousand men under Clinton to occupy Newport, Rhode
 Island. By the offer of bounties some troops were persuaded
 to re-enlist. Two thousand militia were sent forward from
 Philadelphia.
 Above all, Washington rose to the occasion with a bril-
 liant coup at Trenton, dating Christmas night. His plan
 was to take three patties across the half-frozen Delaware
 and surprise the British outposts on the far bank. In more
 ambitious form, it was reminiscent of his dawn assault of
 Jumonville&rsquo;s camp, back in 1754. The scheme was admi-
lably conceived, and though two of the three columns
 were unable to negotiate the river, the principal one &mdash;
Led by Washington &mdash;succeeded. The garrison of fifteen
 hundred Hessians in Trenton was overwhelmed after a
 brief struggle, though five hundred managed to slip away.
 Their performance was abject, no doubt because some of
 then had drunk too much in celebration of Christmas.
Still, that is not to gainsay the high daring of Washington&rsquo;s
 attack, or the boldness of his further stroke, a week. later.
