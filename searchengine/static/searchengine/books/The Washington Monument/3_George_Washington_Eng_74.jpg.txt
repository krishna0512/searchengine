GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQUIRE                                59                        &lsquo;&ldquo;honor.&rsquo;&rsquo; Sometimes Washington defined this so as to make
 it almost synonymous with preferment. It also meant to
 him, however, the &lsquo;&rsquo;Friendly regard of my acquaintances&rdquo;
 (with Sally Fairfax perhaps high on the list). All through
 his adult Life Washington was to be closely concerned with
 his reputation. In part this was simply an aspect of his

 from London. They were of Alexander the Great, Julius
 Caesar, Charles XII of Sweden, Frederick. II of Prussia,
 Prince Eugene and &lsquo;&rsquo;the Duke of Marlborh&rsquo;&rsquo; &mdash; all military
 heroes. His agent was unable to supply them, bat Wash-
 imgton did not accept the busts of poets and philosophers
 that were proffered instead.
 At a time of despondency Colonel Fairfax had consoled
 him with the observation that &lsquo;&ldquo;having Caesar&rsquo;s Commen-
 taries and perhaps Quintas Curtious (the author of a life
 of Alexander) You have therein read of greater Fatigues,
 Murmurings, Mutinys and Defections, than will probably
