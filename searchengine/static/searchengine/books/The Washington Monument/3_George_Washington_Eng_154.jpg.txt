PRESIDENT WASHINGTON                                      139
 Temperamentally and from his experience as com-
 mander in chief, Washington favored a strong national
 government &mdash; or at least one that would be more effectual
 in moments of emergency than the wartime Congress he
 had served. This is clear from his Circular to the States,
 a lengthy memorandum compiled in June 1783, which is
 condensed to a phrase in the toast he offered at a dinner
 in Philadelphia, the day before he surrendered his com-
 mission: "Competent powers to Congress for general pur-
 poses." There is an implication (which, because of his
 scrupulous modesty, appears only now and then in his let-
 ters) that he had begun the work, and through example
 and precept had indicated the path for the new nation
 to follow. Thus, in a letter to John Jay (Foreign Secretary
 under the Confederation) Washington speaks a little pon-
 tifically of the way in which his fellow countrymen have
 neglected his "sentiments and opinions... tho&rsquo; given as
 a last legacy in the most solumn manner." To this extent
 did he identify himself with America his own reputation
 and hers were inextricably interwoven, and it hurt him
 that America should present to outsiders a spectacle of
 disunity. He was especially sensitive to British reactions,
 and naturally annoyed that the British &mdash; the enemy he
 had beaten &mdash; refused to evacuate various Western posts
 according to their treaty obligations. It was the more gall-
 ing that the British had some excuse, since several Ameri-
 can states had likewise failed to honor their treaty prom-
 ises.
 But the letter to Jay was sent in the summer of 1786
 and does not accurately convey Washington&rsquo;s outlook. in
 the previous couple of years. At that period he shrank from
