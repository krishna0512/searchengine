GEORGE WASHINGTON , ESQUIRE 75
 he wore uniform &mdash; the only uniform in the gathering, as
 it chanced. On the way, he reviewed a number of volunteer
 companies; and his companions in Philadelphia could re-
 port similar signs of popular excitement in the districts
 they had traveled through. Indeed, temperatures were rising
 everywhere. In April, at Lexington and Concord, there had
 been a prolonged skirmish between Massachusetts militia-
 men and British regulars from the Boston garrison, who
 had been roughly handled in the affair. In May, just after
 Washington reached Philadelphia, a body of colonials cap-
 tured Fort Ticonderoga, at the northern end of Lake
 George &mdash; the main route to Canada.At about the same
 time, in his own Virginia, the men of Patrick Henry&rsquo;s
 Hanover County were openly challenging the governor&rsquo;s
 authority.
 No one could predict the outcome of so much unrest.
 But the colonies had banded together. The bolder spirits
 represented in the Continental Congress were ready to
 answer force with force. They needed an army and the
 army needed a commander. On Jane 15, 1776, it was re-
 solved that &lsquo;'a General be appointed to command all the
 continental forces raised for the defence of American
 liberty.&rsquo;&rsquo; The day before, in Congress, the influential John
 Adams of Massachusetts, supported by his persuasive col-
 league and namesake Samuel Adams, had put forward the
 name of Colonel Washington. The Virginian, probably
 taken by surprise and certainly confused by the sudden en-
 logy, slipped out of the room. He stayed away on the fif-
 teenth, when his name was put in formal nomination by a
 Maryland delegate and when as a result &lsquo;&lsquo;George Wash-
 ington Esq. was unanimously elected.&rdquo;
