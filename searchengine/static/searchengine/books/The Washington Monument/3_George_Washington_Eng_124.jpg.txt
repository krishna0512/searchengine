GENERAL WASHINGTON                                       109
We shall probably never know the exact truth ot the
 affair. As Washington saw it, a number of malcontents in
 the army combined with others in Congress in a secret
 program to discredit him. The military ringleaders ap-
 peared to be Gates, Mifflin and Thomas Conway (an Irish
 volunteer, formerly a colonel in the French service). Ac-
 cording to the familiar story, their machinations were
 exposed by faithful supporters of Washington (including
Lafayette, who had become his ardent admirer and friend);
Washington then confronted Gates with evidence of the
 plot, and thereby so abashed the conspirators that they
 abandoned their dark projects. However, Bernhard Knol-
lenberg and other recent scholars have questioned the
 orthodox version. They point out that it was natural
 enough at the time to praise Gates, who had vanquished
 Burgoyne, and to be coerespondingly less enthusiastic&mdash;
 for the moment &mdash; over Washington, who had been
 worsted by Howe. Perhaps Gates did not deserve so much
 acclaim, nor Washington so mach blame. But that is the
 way with popular esteem, especially in war; the lucky gen-
 erals are usually promoted, the unlucky ones shelved. It
 may have been ungrateful to grumble at Washington; was
 it, though, lese majestry for a few of his associates to dis-
 cuss his shortcomings in private letters to one another?
 Conway was self-seeking, and perhaps not even sincere at
 that, when he wrote to Gates that he preferred him to
Washington; was he a monster? Washington apparently
 thought so, and most of his biographers have agreed,
 putting themselves not only in his shoes as a biographer
 should) but also in his pocket (which is a blind devotion).
 In consequence they have tended to accept aw given data
