 more briskly in the subsequent pursuits, he might have
 destroyed the Continental army beyond redemption. He
 was to be given another, final chance in 1777.
 Each time the odds grew longer. On the face of it, the
 British had all the advantages. Viewed more closels, their

 more tasks around the world than it could carry out. The
