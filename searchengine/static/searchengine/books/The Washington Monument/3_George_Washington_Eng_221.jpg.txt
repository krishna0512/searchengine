206 GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN AND MONUMENT
 fore he died, and went bankrupt thirty years later. Though
 the Chesapeake 8 Ohio Canal promoters absorbed the old
 Potomac Company, planning to link Washington, D.C,
 with Pittsburgh, they never got further than Cumberland,
 n r;, at the foot of the Alleghenies. George Washing-
 ton had first gone there (when it was known as Wills
 Creek as Far back as 1753, on his earliest errand for
 Governor Dinwiddie. So much effort, and so little to show
 for it.
 The same could be said of other enterprises in which
 he embarked; not that they were ill conceived but that
 they were usually ill fated. Thus, Washington was sin-
 curely and commendably interested in founding a national
 university, in the District of Columbia, to draw together
 youths from all parts of the Union. He allotted it fifty
 Potomac shares in his will; but for various reasons this
 clause of the will remained inoperative.
 As for his association with the Federalists &mdash;an associa-
-tion that he finally acknowledged &mdash; the party came down
 in resounding defeat shortly after his death, and never re-
 gained presidential office. Indeed, it disintegrated as a
 political force. His own reputation suffered for a few years
 through the wreck; the Washington Monument seemed
 almost to have been overthrown in the opening decade of
 the new century.
 All this, perhaps, his contemporaries were hardly in a
 position to appreciate (any more than they could assess;s
 the limitations of his supposedly large fortune). There is
 a profounder pathos that also has become more distinct
 with the passage of time. It lies in the tole of the hero-
 leader, particularly the President, in the United States.
