o4       GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 arote, &ldquo;strike... a damp&rsquo;&rsquo; to the American cause. It was
 is duty, therefore, to face Howe; and in this sense Howe&rsquo;s
 cheme was not altogether futile. Washington was out-
tumbered &mdash; eleven thousand to fifteen thousand &mdash; but
he could choose the ground for an encounter. The place
 we selected was a few miles form Wilmington, where the
Brandywine Creek crossed his front. This was on Septem-
 ber 10. Washington entrusted his right wing to Sullivan
 who had been exchanged after capture on Long Island),
 he center to Nathanael Greene, and the left flank to the
 Pennsylvania militia. The Brandywine could be forded at
several points, but otherwise formed a useful natural) ob-
stacle, especially on the American left.
 Howe&rsquo;s plan of attack was similar to that at Brooklyn:
 1 feint against the American center while the main thrust
was delivered on the lank &mdash; the right flank on this occa-
 ion. It was his standard procedure, and Washington was
Iow in not anticipating it, or even arranging a screen of
 couts. The result was that the battle opened on September
11 with inconclusive clashes in the center, to cover a long
 weep round the flank by Cornwallis. His ten thousand men
 taught Sullivan unprepared and dislodged the American
fight wing. Washington made the best of the situation by
 ending most of his remaining troops, under Greene, to
establish a second line behind Sullivan&rsquo;s retreating divi-
sions. Greene&rsquo;s troops, fighting stubbornly, held on till
flark. Meanwhile, the center, denuded to support the flank,
collapsed under Rowe&rsquo;s pressure. The battle lost its shape;
 at dusk, as the firing died down, weary men straggled back
on disarray, leaving about a thousand of their comrades
 lead and wounded on the field.
