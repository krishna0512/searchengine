GENERAL WASHINGTON 83
 ous, as in his younger days. Washington hated inactivity.
 Against his will he had to wait out the winter of 1775-1776.
 With the spring of 1776, one theme at least became
 gradually clearer amid so much perplexity &mdash; the theme of
 American independence. The desire for independence
 grew by rapid stages, stimulated by proofs that George III,
no less than his ministers (Lord North, Lord George Ger-
 main, the Earl of Sandwich and others), was bent on crush-
 ing the rebellion. &lsquo;&lsquo;Arms as the last resource decide the
 contest; the appeal was the choice of the King, and the
 Continent has accepted the challenge.&rdquo; So declared Tom
 Paine in his pamphlet Common Sense, whose stirring
 sentiments met with passionate approval among most of
 the colonists (including General Washington). A few years
 earlier, Paine&rsquo;s opinions would have sounded like treason
 and blasphemy. In the early months of 1776 there was still
 something shocking in the statement that George III, far
from being the best of kings, was simply &ldquo;the Royal Brute
 of Great Britain.&rsquo;&rsquo; But the shock was delicious, except to
 horrified loyalists &mdash; those whom Nicholas Cresswell, an un-
 fortunate young Englishman who had arrived in the colo-
 nies in 1774, referred to in his journal as Sgnik Sdneirf.
 Sgnik Sdneirf was a pathetically transparent code reference
 to &lsquo;&lsquo;King&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo; Those whom Cresswell angrily de-
scribed as Sleber &mdash; &lsquo;&ldquo;rebels&rsquo;&rsquo; in reverse &mdash; found that Paine
 had decisively reversed beliefs to which they had long paid
 lip service.
 Every thing that is right or reasonable pleads for sepa-
 ration. &lsquo;The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of na-
ture cries, &ldquo;TIS TIME TO PART. Even the distance at
 which the Almighty hath placed England and America
