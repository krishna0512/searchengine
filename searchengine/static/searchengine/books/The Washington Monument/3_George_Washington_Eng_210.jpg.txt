 Theirs was revolution, therefore, by conservation; they did
 not so much invent as discover.
While Rome was an object lesson, it was not a blueprint
 for the infant nation. Many things were needed to make
 the successful transition from monarchy to republicanism
 and from the loose congeries of ex-colonies to the strong
