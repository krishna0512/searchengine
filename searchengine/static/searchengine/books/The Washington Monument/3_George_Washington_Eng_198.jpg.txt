PRESIDENT WASHINGTON  183
 again, to no avail. At ten in the evening of December 14 he
 is dead, without a climax (save for that invented post-
 humously by Parson Weems), without a memorable final
 utterance; in pain, a sacrifice to the well-meaning but bar-
 barous medical treatment of his day.
 With less primitive care he could have survived a few
 more years. He could have witnessed the removal of the
 federal government to Federal City (christened Washing-
 ton, D.C), which would have pleased him, or the in-
 auguration of Thomas Jefferson in 1801, following a Re-
 publican victory that would not have pleased him. He
 could have read of the Louisiana Purchase, and of Hamil-
 ton&rsquo;s death in a duel &mdash; a medley of bright news and dark
 news. But would he have wanted much more? His cen-
 tury was over, and he with it. Spenser&rsquo;s quiet lines fit his
 end better than many of the sonorous phrases that orators
 and scribes (including Freneau) were soon declaiming
 throughout the enormons, ramshackle, thriving Union
 sleep after toyle , port after stormie seas,
 Ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.
