GEORGE WASHINGTON ,  ESQUIRE 
 doah. Since Ferry Farm would  soon come into his hands,
 he could  view his prospects with some satisfaction. If  he
 was not an intellectual  genius, or the heir to a great for-
 tune , he was evidently energetic, reliable &mdash;and canny.
 At the end of 1751 there came a break in his steady

 Barbados , in the hope that the mild climate would  cure
 him. Lawrence&rsquo;s wife had to stay behind with their fourth
 infant, so George went with Lawrence (his only  journey
 outside what was to be the continental United States). The
 experiment failed. Lawrence&rsquo;s health remained poor, and
George succumbed to smallpox. When George recovered,
 he returned alone to Virginia with the cheerless news that
 Lawrence was worse, if anything, and would  probably 
 move on to Bermuda in further search of a remedy. Mean-

 bought another Shenandoah tract, which brought his hold-

 Lawrence&rsquo;s bequests, and opportunities to follow in the
 directions Lawrence had indicated. By the terms of his
 brother&rsquo;s will the widow was to enjoy the use of Mount
 Vernon during her lifetime, in trust for the sole remaining
 child; but if this child died without issue, Mount Vernon
