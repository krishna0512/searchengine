44 GEORGE WWASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 months later Washington arrived back in Williamsburg
 with an equally polite but no less adamant reply from
 Fort Le Boeuf.
 It has been a hard journey, in wretched weather. The
 party traveled by canoe and on horseback, at first on the
 new Ohio Company trail that Gist had been clearing, and
 then through wilderness. They crossed the Potomac water-
 shed to the Youghiogheny valley,' thence to the point where
 the Youghiogheny flowed into the Monongahela, on to
 Shannopin&rsquo;s Town (an Indian settlement close by the Ohio
 forks), on to Logstown, Venango and so to Le Boeuf, al-

Washington &mdash; the wild and broken terrain, the devious
 ways of the Indians, the bland but stubborn French who
&ldquo;told me, That it was their absolute Design to take pos-
 session of the Ohio, and by G&mdash; they would do it.&rsquo;&rsquo; When
 he was at last able to leave, in a desperate hurry to convey
 the disquieting news, Washington pushed ahead with Gist.
 They endured extreme hardship and danger. An Indian
 shot at them from almost point-blank range (fortunately
 he missed); to throw him off the trail, they traveled all
 night, after pretending to pitch camp, then all the next
 day. They had to build a raft in order to cross the half-
frozen Allegheny. George was knocked overboard and
hearly drowned, and spent a miserably cold night in sod-
 den clothing. Oddly enough, though, it was Gist and not
 George that got frostbite.
 Back at length in Williamsburg, he rapidly wrote out an
 account of the journey at Dinwiddie&rsquo;s request. Dinwiddie
 had the narrative printed, no doubt to impress the As-
 sembly with the seriousness of the situation, and it was
