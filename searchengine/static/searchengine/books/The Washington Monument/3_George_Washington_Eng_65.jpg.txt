50           GEORGE WASHINGTON MAN AND MOUMENT
 scores. Straggling to tally the ranks, nearly three quartets
 of their officers became casualties. Braddock, among them,
 bursting with angry courage as he rode to and fro on horse-
 back, was mortally wounded. The Virginia troops behaved
more coolly, according ro Washington, who hastened up
 to join in the contest. His own efforts; and those of others
 were unavailing. Indeed, he was lucky to escape with his
 life; two horses were shot under him, and his clothing torn
 by bullets. Many were less lucky. The woods became a
 slaughter ground. Close on nine handred of Braddock&rsquo;s
men lay dead or wounded, a harvest of scalps for the yelling
 Indians (&lsquo;&ldquo;The terrific sound&rdquo; of their whoops "will haunt
 me tilI the hour ot my dissolation,&rdquo; said a British officer
 afterwards) as the demoralized survivors poured back in
terreat.
 The disaster might still have been amended if Brad-
 dock&rsquo;s second-in-command had gathered tha remnants and
 again advanced on Duquesne. In fact, the battle might
 easily have gone the other way. Braddock was not as foolish
 as tradition alleges: his men were not taken completely by
 surprise; he outnumbered the French; and if the sortie
 from Duquesne had been less audacious, it would have
 failed. Yet these post-mortem reflections could not alter
 the shameful reality of defeat. Duquesne was still French,
 and the whole Virginia frontier lay exposed to marauding
 Indians, jubilant with victory.
 There was some comfort for Washington. Whatever the
 general dismay and recrimination, his own reputation did
 not suffer. He was known to have behaved gallantly, al-
 though a sick man. &ldquo;Permit me now Sir,&rsquo;&rsquo; the governor of
 North Carolina wrote, &ldquo;wo congtatulate sou on Your Late
