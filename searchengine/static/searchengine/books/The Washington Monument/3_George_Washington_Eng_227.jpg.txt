212 GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN AND MONUMENT
As perhaps in the career of any great man, there is a
deeply sad Flavor to the life of Washington. It is poignant
 to inspire awe rather than intimate affection, to have the
 warm flesh strike cold like marble, because one&rsquo;s tempera-
 ment was thus, and because America insisted on such
frozen excellence. It is melancholy to be entrusted with
 vast responsibilities, as aware as Washington was of one&rsquo;s
 own shortcomings. It is grim to be plunged into an end-
less sequence of war, controversy and crisis, walking the
 knife edge of catastrophe.
 Yet Washington&rsquo;s is also a deeply satisfying rec-
 ord. Here was a man who did what he was asked to do,
 and whose very strength resided in a sobriety some took
 for fatal dullness; who in his own person proved the
 soundness of America. A good man, not a saint; a com-
 petent soldier, not a great one; an honest administrator,
 not a statesman of genius; a prudent conserver, not a bril-
liant reformer. But in sum an exceptional figure.
 His private solace was to know at the last that his path
 had been straight forward and honorable, that he was dying
 in the house he liked better than anywhere else on earth,
 watched over by the wife to whom he had been faithful
 for forty years. His public achievement is the inverse meas-
 ure. He died knowing that America was intact, that he
 as much as any person had assisted in its formation, and
 that while his own sands ran out, time was still on the side
 of his country. It was an achievement of far more perma-
 nent effect than most in history.
 How much of the credit is due to him alone we cannot
say; in the final analysis the question is irrelevant. He
 had become so merged with America that his is one of the
