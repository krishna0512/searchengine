PRESIDENT WASHINGTON 145
 Delaware and New Jersey; and men From the smaller
 states clung to the principle of equal representation that
 had been granted under the Articles of Confederation. Sev-
 eral times the convention was near deadlock. But by de-
 grees it moved forward; and  Washington shared the con-
 viction of a majority of his colleagues that its compromises
 were workmanlike. Politics was the art of the possible; the
 new Constitution was the best that could be drawn up in
 the circumstances.
Washington, at any rate, thought so. He could approve
 of its provisions for an executive in the shape of a Presi-
 dent), for a Congress (of two houses, a Senate and a
 House of Representatives) and for a judicial system
 headed by a federal Supreme Court. Each branch was
 separated from the others. The arrangement made sense
 to him in terms of his own experience; the President
 would be something like the Governor of Virginia (except
 that there would be mo instructions and vetoes emanating
 from London), the Senate like the Governor&rsquo;s Council
 (with two members from each state, it would be a com-
 pact group of twenty-six seasoned counselors) and the
 House of Representatives comparable to the Virginia Gen-
 eral Assembly. Indeed, Virginia would have an influen-
 tial voice in its proceedings, since she as the most popu-
 lous state would have more members &mdash; ten, for example,
 as against only one for lowly Rhode Island &mdash; than any
 other.
While the individual states would retain a degree of
 autonomy, the Constitution pleased Washington by put-
 ting teeth into the federal government. It would exercise
 in practice powers that Congress had hitherto wielded
