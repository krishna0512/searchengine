208     GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MOUMENT
haved more like a republican general and less like a so-
 called Eastern monarch, he would still have been dispar-
 aged; indeed, the outcome might have been disastrous for
 the United States. &lsquo;The role of the President, in short, is a
 strange, vulgar-lofty conception, at the very core of the
 American mystery. It demands solemnity and yet invites
 scurrility. He is almost like one of those primitive kings in
 Frazer&rsquo;s Golden Bough who reign in pomp until they are
 ritually put to death (except, maybe, that the American
 ruler undergoes slow torture long before his final extinc-
 tion). The urge to worship and the urge to denigrate
 seem complementary &mdash; a uniquely uncomfortable circum-
 stance for Washington, since he entered office as more of
 a public hero than any other American statesman has
 been. During his administration &mdash; Washington was no ex-
 ception &mdash; the President is sapposed to reveal miraculous
 wisdom and foresight, and also to be an ordinary man. He
 is left peculiarly vulnerable. Everything is expected of
 him, nothing tangible is given him, except on loan: no
 titles, houses, decorations. He is almost a living sacrifice
 to the state.
 John Adams&rsquo;s petulant comments on Washington are
 significant here. It was, he maintains, egotistical? of Wash-
 ington to serve without salary, and equally wrong to seek.
retirement after eight years of military command (he
 Wrote before Washington became President).
 In wiser and more virtuous times he would not have
done) that, for that is an ambition. Re would still be
 content to be Governor of Virginia, President of Con-
 gress, a member of the Senate, or a House of Representa-
 tives.
