GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQUIRE        57
 dence might have marked for great things. But in his own
 view, at least in pesswimistic moments, these were lost years
 &mdash; in every sense, years in the wilderness. His services went
 unrecognized; his luck was out. Braddock was killed; Brad-
 dock&rsquo;s successors seemed unimpressed by Washington&rsquo;s tal-
 ents. How, then, could he make his point? If he failed, it
 was not for want of trying. When Lord Loudoun became
 commander in chief in North America, Washington wrote
 (January 1757):
 Altho&rsquo; I had not the honor to be known to your Lord-
 ship, your Lordship&rsquo;s name was familiar to my eat, on
 account of the important services performed to his Ma-
-jesty in other parts of the world. Do not think, my Lord,
 that I am going to flatter: not with standing I have exalted
 sentiments of your Lordship&rsquo;s character and respect your.
 rank, it is rot my intention to adulate. My nature is open
 and honest and free from guile!...
 With regard to myself, I cannot forebear adding, that
 had his Excellency General Braddock survived his unfor-
 tunate defeat, I should have met with preferment agree-
 able to my wishes. I had his promise to that purpose, and
 I believe that gentleman was too sincere and generous to
 make unmeaning offers.
 By the spring of 1758 he said he had &lsquo;&lsquo;laid aside all hopes
 of preferment in the Military line.&rsquo;&rdquo; Nevertheless, he sent
 two slightly unctuous letters to British regular officers of
 his acquaintance, asking them to recommend him to Gen-
 eral Forbes &lsquo;&rsquo;as one who would gladly be distinguished...
from the common run of provincial officers.&rdquo; And in June
 1758 he welcomed the arrivaI of Dinwiddie&rsquo;s successor,
 Lieutenant Governor Fauquier, with a similar assortment
 of overdone flattery and modesty.
