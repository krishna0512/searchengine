 but masculine faces of the eighteenth-century portraits
 often beat a striking resemblance to Roman portrait busts,
 and &mdash; conversely &mdash; the memorial statuary of the period
 harks straight back to the ancient world. Consider, for in-
 stance, some of the monuments in Westmirster Abbey. In
 one by Roubillac to General Wade (1748) &ldquo;the Goddess
 of Fame is preventing Time from destroying the General&rsquo;s
 trophies.&rsquo;&rsquo; In another by the same sculptor to Admiral Sit
 Peter Warren (1752) &lsquo;&lsquo;Hercules places the bust of the
 Admiral on a pedestal, while Navigation looks on with
 mournful admiration.&rsquo;&rsquo; In a third monument to Admiral
Watson (1757), designed by Scheemakers, &ldquo;the Admiral
 in a toga is sitting in the centre holding a palm branch. On
 the right the town of Calcutta, on her knees, presents a
 petition.&rsquo;&rsquo; Consciously or unconsciously, the gentleman of
 Washington&rsquo;s day drew much of his metaphor and his
 code of values from Rome. Not all, but enough for us to
 catch from the Roman ambience an illuminating glimpse
 of Washington and his background.
 It is no accident that he frequently quoted from Addi-
 son&rsquo;s Cato, or that, casting about for a sentiment to in-
 scribe in the Fairfax. guestbook at Belvoir, his elder brother
 Lawrence put down, &ldquo;Virtus omnia pericula vincit&rdquo; (Cour-
 age overcomes all dangers). Cato was one of the centutry&rsquo;s
 favorite plays. It may well have been in the mind of the
 young Connecticut hero, Nathan Hale, whom the British
 executed as a spy in 1776. At any rate, Hale&rsquo;s last utterance.
 &ldquo;I only regret that I have but one life to give for my coun-
 try,&rsquo;&rsquo; echoes Addison&rsquo;s
 What pity is it
 &lsquo;That we can die but once to save our country&rsquo;
