182 GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN MONUMENT
 groan. When Hamilton predicted that another summons
 to action would reach him, Washington repied that he
 would go &ldquo;with as much reluctance from my present
 peaceful abode, as I should do to the tomb of my ances-
 tors.&rdquo; He was displeased when President Adams nomi-
 nated him as commander in chief without previous con-
 sultation. He was worried, as before in his career, that op-
 ponents might interpret his return to authority as a piece
 of ambition or &mdash; in view of his Farewell Address &mdash; hy-
 pocrisy. But the obligation was not to be evaded. Brisk,
 sensible, conscientious, he set about the task. As before, the
 ubiquitous Alexander Hamilton was promptly on hand, ar-
 ranging things behind the scenes, securing for himself an
 appointment that would make him Washington&rsquo;s second-
 in-command. It was a hectic time, especially for poor John
 Adams. In his place, Washington would probably have
 come in for similar vilification. But we can be fairly sure
 that Washington would have avoided some of Adams&rsquo;s
 tactical blunders in the business of administration. A de-
 tailed comparison of his Presidency with Washington&rsquo;s
 would do much to bring out the solid, sober merit of the
latter.
 However, there was no war in 1798 or in 1799. Wash-

 by in the jog-trot entries of his diary. Hot days, cool days,
rain, snow. Surveying, riding, visitors, dinners, a baby
 daughter born to his niece Betty Lewis. Then the diary
 stops on December 13, with a note that the thermometer
 has dropped to a slight frost. Then, indeed, the curtain
 comes down with a rush. Washington has caught a chill;
 he has a sore throat; the doctors bleed him, bleed him
