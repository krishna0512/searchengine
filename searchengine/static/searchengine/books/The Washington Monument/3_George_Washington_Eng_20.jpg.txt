THE WASHIGTON MONUENT              5
 reacted in various ways. In the case of Shakespeare, some
 have denied his authorship of the plays and have attempted
 to substitute a more plausible bard: a Bacon or even a
 Marlowe. The reaction in the case of Washington has
 naturally been somewhat otherwise. No one, in face of
 such a quantity of evidence, can pretend he never existed,
 or that some other man deserves the credit. But he has
 become entombed in his own myth &mdash; a metaphorical
 Washington Monument that hides from us the lineaments
 of the real man. Year by year this monument has grown,
 like a cairn to which each passer-by adds a stone. Pamphlet,
 speech, article and book; pebble, rubble, stone and boulder
 have piled up. Anecdote, monograph, panegyric: whatever
 the level and value of each contribution it has somehow &mdash;
 ironically, in the instance of more important contributions
 &mdash; smothered what it seeks to disclose.
 Indeed, Washington has become not merely a mythical
 figure, but a myth of suffocating dullness, the victim of
 civic elephantiasis. Confronted by the shelves and shelves
 of &lsquo;&ldquo;Washingtoniana&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash; all those sonorous, repetitious, rev-
 erential items, the set pieces in adulation that are im-
 possible to read without yawning &mdash; we seek some sour
 antidote to so much saccharine, and tend to agree with
Emerson: &lsquo;&ldquo;Every hero becomes a bore at Iast.... They
 cry up the virtues of George Washington &mdash; Damn George
 Washington!&rsquo; is the poor Jacobin&rsquo;s whole speech and con-
futation.&rsquo;&rdquo; When we have allowed ourselves the relief of
 this irreverence, though, the monument still looms before
 us, and must be reckoned with before we can get to grips
 with Washington the man. We may suspect, however, that
 myth and man can never be entirely separated, and that
