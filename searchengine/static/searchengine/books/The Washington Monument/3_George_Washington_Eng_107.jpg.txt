92      GEORGE WASHINGTON, MAN AND MONUMENT
 Howe would have beaten General Washington; and any
 other General in the world than General Washington
 would have beaten General Howe." With the forces at his
 disposal in 1776, Washington had practically no chance of
 defeating the British, but he did blunder. At Brooklyn
 Heights he made the mistake of reinforcing failure; a
 sharper opponent would not have allowed him the luxury
 of second thoughts. His subsequent movements were,
 though not panicky, indecisive and clumsy. The loss of Fort
Washington, or rather of its large garrison and its precious
 cannon and supplies, was in part at least his fault.
 Moreover, he was reluctant to acknowledge his mistakes.
 The line between righteonsness and self-righteousness is
 always a narrow one; and Washington, though he had
 matured impressively since his Virginia colonel days, still
 showed a tendency to confuse the two. He suffered acutely
 when he was under criticism, or felt he might be. Over and
 over, in the letters he wrote during 1776, and again in 1777,
 he insisted that he did not object to fair criticism; yet, since
 only he and his close associates were fully aware of his
"choice of difficulties,&rdquo; how could any criticism be fair?
 Desperately concerned for his &ldquo;honor," he was still a shade
 too ready to shift the onus onto others. Thus, he was not
 quite just to his faithful general, Nathanael Greene, in his
 account of the Fort Washington surrender. And he was in-
 clined to overstress his vexations at the hands of Congress.
 Militarily, Washington still had mach to learn. Tem-
 peramentally, he was something less than perfect. But he
 as capable ot learning; and, in balance, his temperament
 was extremely well adapted to the task before him. In his
 initial lapses we may discern the source of his ultimate
