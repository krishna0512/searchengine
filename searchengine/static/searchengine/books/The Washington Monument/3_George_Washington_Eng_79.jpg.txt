GEORGE WASHINGTON , MAN AND MONUMENT 
 munity, near the head of things &mdash; and, one would guess,
 of a family man.
 Since this is very much what Washington was, we can
 conclude that it was an accurate portrait. He had no chil-
 dren of his own; however, he was a family man as far as
 Martha&rsquo;s children were concerned, and though Patsy died
 in 1773, Jackie was married only a few months afterward,
 and before long had two children to engage the grand-
 fatherly affections of Colonel Washington. He was uncle
 or guardian to a whole brood of other children.
 One deraly wishes that we had another, earlier portrait
 to set beside Peale&rsquo;s.? If we could see Washington in, say,
 1757, we should  get a glimpse of an individual who was
 far less mature. As he confronts us in 1772, we can under-
 stand why adjectives such as &lsquo;&rsquo;sagacious&rdquo; were so often ap-
 plied to him. He seems poised, almost benign &mdash; the master
 of himself and his surroundings. In 1757, by contrast,
 he might have appeared able but a trifle on edge. We
 can almost imagine him scowling a little and adopt-
 ing a belligerent stance, like those anonymous, pathetic
 young heroes, a century later, in daguerreotypes of the
 Civil War.
 In the intervening years George Washington, as we can
 clearly gather from his correspondence, grew in moral
 stature. &lsquo;This is not to say that be underwent any sudden
 conversion. The road back to Mount Vernon was not for
 him the road to Damascus. Ignatius Loyola was a warrior
until  he sickened of  bloodshed while convalescing at. Pam-
 &ldquo;There is tn Tact a miniature portrait, attributed to J.S.Coptey, which
 awed to be accepted at a likeness of Washington done in as. This now
seems most unlikely; and tn any case, the portrait is too mild and innoc-
 uous to suggest the character of its subject, whoever he may be.
