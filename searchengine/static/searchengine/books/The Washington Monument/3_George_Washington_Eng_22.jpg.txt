THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT     7
 surname appropriate for one American state, seven moun-
 tains, eight streams, ten lakes, thirty-three counties; for
 nine American colleges; for one hundred and twenty-one
 American towns and villages. His birthday has long been
 a national holiday. His visage is on coins and banknotes
 and postage stamps; his portrait (usually the snaffle-
 mouthed, immensely grave &lsquo;&rsquo;Athenaeum&rsquo;&rsquo; version by Gil-
 betrt Stuart) is hung in countless corridors and offices. His
 head &mdash; sixty feet from chin to scalp &mdash; has been carved out
 of a mountainside in South Dakota. &lsquo;There are statues of
 him all over the United States &mdash; and all over the world:
 you can see them in London and in Paris, in Buenos Aires
 and Rio de Janeiro, in Caracas and Budapest and
 Tokyo...
 All these are outward signs of Washington&rsquo;s heroic
 standing in the world. But we should look a little&rsquo; more
 closely at the monument. If the metaphor may be extended,
 we can observe that the monument has four sides: four
roles that Washington has been made to play for posterity&rsquo;s
 sake. The four are not sharply distinct &mdash; nothing is, in this
 misty Valhalla &mdash; but it is worth our while to take a glance
 at each of them before turning to the actual events from
 which the legends emanated. This is, of course, not to argue
 that Washington is undeserving of praise; his merits were
 genuine and manifold. The crucial point is that the real
 merits were enlarged and distorted into unreal attitudes,
 and that this overblown Washington is the one who occurs
 immediately to us when his name is mentioned. He might
 occur in any or all of the following four guises: a) the
Copybook Hero; b) the Father of His People; c) the Dis-
 interested Patriot; d) the Revolutionary Leader. These are
