GEORGE WASHINGTON , ESQUIRE
 plona; so was Francesco Bernardone until he turned back
 in the middle of an expedition, to start existence afresh as
 Francis of Assisi. Not so George Washington. There was
 no moment of revelation. It is true that he was a sound
 Episcopalian, but his religion, though no doubt perfectly
 sincere, was a social performance, quite lacking in angels
 or visions &mdash; except for those that Parson Weems contrived
 for him. He was a Christian as a Virginia planter under-

 he stood to pray, instead of kneeling; and he did not in-
 variably go to church on Sundays. Perhaps illness had an
 effect upon him, as it had &mdash; more dramatically &mdash; upon
 Loyola and Saint Francis. He was dangerously sick in the
 winter of 1757-1758, and again in 1761, when he wrote
 that &lsquo;&rsquo;I once thought the grim King would certainly master
 my utmost efforts and that I must sink in spite of a noble
 struggle.&rsquo;&rdquo; The prospect of death does concentrate a man&rsquo;s

 Yet there is not very much to be got out of the attempt
 to visualize Washington as a wartior saint. The most we
 can say (and it is a good deal) is that, like Loyola or Saint
 Ftancis, he showed a capacity for growth; his character im-
 proved, if not to the point of sanctity. Thus a biographer
 investigting Washington&rsquo;s career up to 1759  could main-

 was involved. For instance, when Washington was forced
 to hand Van Braam over to the French as a hostage at Fort
 Necessity, he sold Van Braam a dress uniform which he
 might otherwise have found a nuisance to carry away with
 him. It was not a shatmeful transaction, but it was a brisk
 one. After his retirement, however, Washington lent money
