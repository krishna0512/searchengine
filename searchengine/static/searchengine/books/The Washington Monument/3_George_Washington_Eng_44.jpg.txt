GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQUIRE                                     29
 her first-born child: George Washington. Otherwise he
 might perhaps have been given the family name of John;
 Lawrence and Augustine had already been used for his
 half brothers. At any rate, George it was.
 The baby George was born in Westmoreland County, at
 a plantation later known as Wakefield. It was also described
 as Pope&rsquo;s Creek or Bridges&rsquo; Creek, since it lay between those
 two streams, which emptied into the Potomac some way
 downriver from the Hunting Creek poperty. George&rsquo;s
 birth date was February 11, 1732. When the calendar was
 revised in 1752, eleven days were added, so that this date
 subsequently became February 22, New Style.) Five other
 children came in rapid succession: Elizabeth, Samuel, John
 Augustine, Charles and Mildred, who died in infancy in
 1740.
 By then young George was living in his third home. In
 1735 his father had moved to Prince William County.
 Three years later he moved again, to Ferry Farm near the
 little settlement of Fredericksburg on the Rappahannock.
 The father had worries and disappointments, especially
 with his iron foundry, bat he was fairly well entrenched as
 a Virginian of the upper, though not the top, level. He
 owned about fifty slaves. He acquired title to all the lands
 he could encompass: something over ten thousand acres,
 as enumerated in his will. He sent Lawrence and Augus-
 tine, the two sons of his first marriage, to the school he had
 himself attended, at Appleby in northern England. Thus
 might they acquire the breadth and polish befitting a Vir-
 ginia gentleman; through luck, shrewd investment and a
 careful marriage they might amass the wealth to accompany
 such manners.
