GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQUIRE                            55
 he complained in December 1756, "are dark, doubtful,
 and uncertain; to-day approved, to-morrow condemned.&rdquo;
 His whole position was ambiguous and anomalous, giving
 him the semblance of power but not much actual author-
 ity. He and his force in 1754 received less pay than troops
from other colonies. Though a colonel, he was outranked
 by every captain who happened to hold a royal (or regular)
 commission instead of a militia one. A Captain Mackay
 who brought a company from North Carolina in 1754
 would not acknowledge Colonel Washington as his chief;
 nor, a few months later, would a Captain Dagworthy whose
 royal commission was only a memory since he had retired
 and sold his pension rights. And Washington must have
 known that British regular officers as a group were dis-
 dainful of the provincials (one of them referred to Virginia
militia officers as "Jockeys,&rdquo; and another remarked pri-
 vately that "a planter is not to be taken from the plough
 and made an officer in a day").
 All this understandably irritated Washington. The strik-
 ing feature is that it did more; it rankled with him, it
 drove him to the pitch ot fury. Granted that he was honest
 and competent, we must feel that he insisted on his own
virtues too often in his letters to Dinwiddie and others.
 One clue is provided by the fact that, back in 1753, he

 If that was the act of a brave and patriotic Virginian, it
 was also the act of an extremely ambitious young man. His
 subsequent acts and correspondence reveal that he was not
 a wild romantic. Reputation, though sought in the cannon&rsquo;s
 mouth, was not for him a bubble but a solid matter of
 recognition and reward. He had, so to speak, speculated
