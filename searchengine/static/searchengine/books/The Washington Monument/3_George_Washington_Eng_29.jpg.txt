 Lee) as they objected, for example, to Thackeray&rsquo;s treat-
 ment of Washington in T&rsquo;he Virginians. &ldquo;Why,&rsquo;&rsquo; one angry
 reviewer wrote, "this is the very essence of falsehood. Wash-
ington was not like other men; and to bring his lofty char-
 acter down to the level of the vulgar passions of common
 life, is to give the lie to the grandest chapter in the unin-
 spired annals of the human race.&rsquo;&rsquo; As another critic admon-

 spotless, and if you impute to him the little follies that have

 in Houdon&rsquo;s statue, and freeze you into silence with his
 calm, reproachful gaze."
 This ia a remarkable threat, and it conveys very well the
 intensity of American feeling for Washington a century
 ago. A similar protective reverence was revealed by Jared
 Sparks when he edited Washington&rsquo;s correspondence in the
 1830s. He was afterwards accused of having tampered with
 the text in order to present Washington in a more dignified
 light. His editorial methods were, by modern standards, so
 careless that it is difficult to detect any clear line of policy.
But Sparks does seem to have omitted or altered passages
 that might he regarded as vulgar; to cite two notorious in-
 stances, Washington&rsquo;s reference to "OId Put" was changed
 to "General Putnam,&rsquo;&rsquo; while &lsquo;&lsquo;but a flea-bite at present&rsquo;&rsquo; was
 rendered as &ldquo;totally inadequate to our demands at this
 time.&rdquo; Consciously or unconsciously, Sparks (an able his-
 torian in many ways) reflected the American belief that
 Washington was not like other men.&rdquo; To admit failings in
 him was therefore to attack the very fabric ot America. tn
