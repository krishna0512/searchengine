GEORGE WASHINGTON , ESQUIRE            27
 away a fortune he did not possess and that neither he not
 the new &ldquo;Proprietor&rsquo;&rsquo; had ever seen or was ever to see.
 Another small incident of the Civil War in England &mdash;
 typical of what befell thousands of unlucky men &mdash; was the
 expulsion from his living of an Anglican minister by the
 Puritans in 1643. His name was Lawrence Washington. He
 had lived in modest comfort (his family had owned the
 manor of Sulgrave, in Northamptonshire, and he himself
 was a former Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford). Now he
 found survival difficult; and after he died in 1653, two of
 his sons decided to make a fresh start in Virginia. One of
 them, John, came as a ship&rsquo;s officer, married the daughter
 of a Virginia landowner and &mdash; perhaps half by accident
 &mdash; settled there. In general he prospered. He acquired land;
 he became a justice of the peace and a burgers (i.e., a
 member of the lower house of the Virginia General As-
 sembly). His brother was also reasonably successful. The
Washington line was established. It could hardly be called
 a dynasty, as yet. Neither brother made a fortune. Life was
 precarious and rough, death ever-present. John, for ex-
 ample, had three wives, the last of whom had already been
 widowed three times, and he was still only in his middle
 forties when he died in 1677.
 Nevertheless, the Washington name quietly joined those
 others &mdash; Byrd, Carter, Corbin, Fitzhugh, Harrison, Lee,
 Page, Randolph &mdash; that we associate with Virginia. John&rsquo;s
 eldest son, Lawrence, carried on the line, benefiting as elder
 sons did from the rules of inheritance that were to char-
 acterize the colony. Lawrence too was a burgess; but he
 died in 1698, at the age of thirty-nine, before he was able to
 fasten much grip upon his surroundings. And now the story
