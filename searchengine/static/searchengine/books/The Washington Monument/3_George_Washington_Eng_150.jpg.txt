PRESIDENT  WASHINGTON                    135
 a Frenchman sent a pack of hounds; a European noble-
 man requested a portrait of Washington for inclusion in a
 gallery of military heroes. Remembering (if he did) his
 own abortive collection of that kind, Washington was en-
 titled to feel that the Virginia colonel of militia was at
 last reaping his reward.
 There were other compensations. Little by little he es-
 tablished a routine that enabled him, without slighting his
 guests, to handle his own affairs. For exercise there was
 the almost daily ride around his farms, and in the winter
 months the delight of fox hunting. There was the pleas-
 ure of watching Mount Vernon approach the elegance
 he had planned for it; the comfort of a congenial mar-
 riage (though visitors occasionally found the General dis-
 agreeably stiff, they all praised Martha&rsquo;s amiable temper);
 and the stimulation of young children &mdash; two of Jacky Cus-
 tis&rsquo;s offspring were adopted by the Washingtons after their
 mother remarried.
 Above all, there was his third enthusiasm, for opening
 up the country. In 1782 he had taken advantage of a
 quiet spell to travel in northern New York and buy a tract
 there. He was still interested in the Dismal Swamp, be-
 tween Virginia and North Carolina. And there were ex-
 citing prospects somewhat nearer home. Indeed, one of the
 purposes of his western jourmey in 1784 was to examine
 these. He came back convinced that Virginia and the
West could and should be linked by water. The Potomac
 was navigable for a considerable distance upstream, and
 only a short portage divided it from the headwaters of the
 Ohio River system. When the necessary improvements had
 been made (the chief one a canal around the Potomac falls),
