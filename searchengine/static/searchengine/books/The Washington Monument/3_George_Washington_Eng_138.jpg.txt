GENERAL  WASHINGTON                                          123
 rigid, monitory sound; they are full of rebuke and prohibi-
 tion, and where they are appreciative they are still a tittle
 glacial. They do not give praise; they bastow it.
 It would be silly to stretch this point, and expect an
 eighteenth-century Virginia planter to behave like a twen-
 tieth-century expert in public relations. Yet he did strike
 even his contemporary associates as a reserved person. The
 war meant everything to him, but he did not &mdash;verbally

 However, these are hardly serious shortcomings, as we
 may see by looking again at that other American general
 named George: George B. McClellan, who for a while
