THE WHOLE MAN     193
 in one is Roman; Cincinnatus is among many Roman he
 roes who combined these functions. So are the details Ro-
 man. There is something of Rome in Washington&rsquo;s family
 situation: his abiding attachment to Mount Vernon, his du-
 tiful, if unenthusiastic, concern for his mother, his uncom-.

 nephews, nieces, stepchildren and other kinsmen. Generos-

 back to the genus, or clan); yet more than mere good na-

 Duty. Here is another Roman clue to Washington : duty
 seen as a cluster of obligations. obligations, be it noted,
rather than some more modern word such as &ldquo;compul-

 supeficial, nor impatient, nor yet contemptuous in his
 attitude towards death, but to await it as one of the oper-
 ations of Nature which he will have to undergo.
 Marcus Aurelius said this; Washington could have, as he
 made his will, issued his Farewell Address to the Ameri-
