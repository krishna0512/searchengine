THE WASHINGTON   MONUMENT 
 logically and emotionally: America&rsquo;s first commander in
 chief and first President. He was the prime native hero, a
 necessary creation for a new country. It was only natural to

 Capitol and shows Washington flanked by Freedom and
 Victory. Not car one imagine American critics objecting to

 American hero, with the possible exception of other .

 which was torn away by a ball from the American artillery in the battle
 of Princeton,&rdquo;&ldquo;
