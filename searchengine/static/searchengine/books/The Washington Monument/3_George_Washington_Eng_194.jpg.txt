PRESIDENT WASHINGTON 
 Democratic societies, most of which were harmless politi-
 cal clubs; hence his indignant comment in a letter of 1798
 that &ldquo;you could as soon scrub the blackamore white, as to
 change the principles of a profest Democrat,&rsquo;&rdquo; and that
 such a man &lsquo;&rsquo;will leave nothing unattempted to overturn
 the Government of this Country.&rsquo;&rdquo; His final cabinet was en-
 tirely Federalist in composition.
 From this it was only a step &mdash; a step that, nevertheless.
 he probably took unconsciously &mdash; to acknowledging that
 he himself was a Federalist. In 1799, the last year of his
 life, when he had been out of office for two years, Wash-
 ington was urged to stand as a candidate in the presiden-
 tial election of 1800, on the grounds that the Union was in
 grave danger. He refused, explaining that &lsquo;&ldquo;principle, not
 men, is now, and will be, the object of contention.&rdquo; Even if
 he put himself forward, &lsquo;&lsquo;I should not draw a single vote
From the Anti-federal side; and of course, should stand
upon no stronger ground than any other Federal well sup-
 ported.&rsquo;&rsquo; He was not quite ready to concede that the Re-
 publicans were a legitimate group; yet from his letter as a
 whole (&lsquo;&rsquo;any other Federal we see that he was beginning
 to grasp the altered basis of American politics.
 If he had still been in office, he might not have been will-
 ing to label himself a Federalist; he might have main-
 trained that the President must still strive to stand aloof.
 Certainly no serious blame attaches to him; but on this is-
 sue he did not achieve the lofty and prescient calm that
 some biographers have acclaimed in him. Only by seeing
 the decade entirely through Washington&rsquo;s or through
Federalist eyes can we agree that he justly  formulated  the
 political equation.
