 success on Long Island, he delayed further operations in
 order to hold a parley with the enemy. He and Admiral
Howe were to be employed again as commissioners in 1778,
 while still responsible for the conduct of the war. But their
victories were too mild, and their terms too harsh.
 In part, of course, the trouble lay with their lack of mili-
 tary genius. Britain had had a Blake, and was to produce

 nor &ldquo;Gentleman Johnny" Burgoyne was a Wellington.
 This is not to say that they were altogether incompetent;
 nor was Lord George Germain, who as secretary of state for
 the colonies directed the war from London, as viciously
 silly as some commentators have asserted. All the British
 commanders in the field were moderately good soldiers,
 courageous, methodical, and skilled tn the art of European
 warfare. The best of therm, Cornwallis, had a highly suc-
 cessful subsequent career in other parts of the wold. Their
 misfortune was that they were not great soldiers. They were
 not unperceptive; indeed, they were tale too clearly aware
 of their problems. As in some old fairy tale, they were to be
 vouchsafed three chances &mdash; the first golden, the others in-
 creasingly tarnished &mdash;to end the war at a stoke. This itst
 chance was given to Gage on Charlestown peninsula in
 June 1775. It he had been prudent in attacking Breed&rsquo;s
 Hill, and then bold in following up his opportunity, in-
 stead of the other way around, he might have shattered
 Artemas Ward&rsquo;s inchoate army before Washington ever
 arrived on the scene. The second chance was given to Howe
on Long Island and afterward. If he had burst through
