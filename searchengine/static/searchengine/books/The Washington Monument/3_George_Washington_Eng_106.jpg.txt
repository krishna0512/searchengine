GENERAL WASHINGTON   91
 Having again crossed the Delaware, he was almost trapped
 by Cornwallis, but nimbly extricated himself, fighting a
 successful skirmish at Princeton on the way.
 It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of these
 ventures in their effect upon patriotic morale or upon
 Washington&rsquo;s own reputation. On January 17, 1777, Nich-
 olas Cresswell was at -Leesburg, Virginia. After talking
 with an acquaintance there, Cresswell noted in his journal:
 Six weeks ago this gentleman was lamenting the un-
 happy situation of the Americans and pitying the
 wretched condition of their much-beloved General, sup-
 posing his want of skill and experience in military mat-
 ters had brought them all to the brink of destruction. In
 short, all was gone, all was lost. But now the scale is
 turned and Washington&rsquo;s name is extolled to the clouds.
 ,..It is the Damd Hessians that has caused this, curse
 the scoundrel that first thought of sending them here.
 After Princeton, Washington remained quiet for the
 winter at his Morristown headquarters. Howe withdrew
 the Delaware outposts, concentrating his garrisons around
 New Brunswick. For both sides it was a period in which
 to take stock. We may do the same, first with reference to
 the American position.

 York. A British comment, at a later stage in the war, was
 that &ldquo;any other General in the world other than General
