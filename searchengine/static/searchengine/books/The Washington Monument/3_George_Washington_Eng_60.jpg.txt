 impressed enough to vote him fifty pound. He had a new
 patron in Dinwiddie, who, according to legend, com-

What followed seemed to prove that destiny had marked
 him out. Dinwiddie planned an expedition to hold the
 Ohio country, and Washington was chosen as its second-
 in-command with a lieutenant colonel&rsquo;s commission in the
 Virginia militia. While Washington was recruiting his
 force, Gist and another agent of the Ohio Company &mdash;
 William Trent &mdash; were busy on the frontier, building a
 company warehouse on the Monongahela and a company
 fort at the forks of the Ohio. Trent was given a captain&rsquo;s
 commission and told to recruit a company of frontiersmen.
 -ieutenant Colonel Washington was instructed to reinforce
 Trent with two more companies.
 He set out on this mission in April 1754, from Alex-
 andria. With him were eight subordinate officers includ-
 ing Van Braam, for whom Washington had procured a
 captaincy), a surgeon, &lsquo;&ldquo;a Swedish gentleman volunteer&rsquo;&rdquo;
 and one hundred  fifty men. A three weeks&rsquo; march brought
 his command to Wills&rsquo; Creek on the upper Potomac later
 the site of Fort Cumberland). Here an alarming rumor
 was confirmed: Trent had been ousted fron the Ohio
 forks by a far superior French force and was withdrawing
 toward Wills Creek. However, the neighboring Indians
 affirmed their loyalty. Encouraged by their fidelity, and
 eager to prove himself, Washington agreed with his officers
 that they should continue on as far as the Monongahela
