80 THEABBEY OF BLISS
 released Satyananda and Mahendra and began to dance
 with joy and there was a great noise of Haribol, After
 getting them out of goal, Children set fire to the houses
 of the Mussulmans wherever they found them. Then
 Satyananda said 'Turn back, friends, it&rsquo;s no use to
 make havoc where there is no need for it.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 When news of these outrages of the children reach-
 ed the authorities they despatched a body of Pergunnah
 Sepoys to suppress them, They had not only match-
 locks but also a cannon with them, On their approach,
 the children issued from the Wood  of Bliss and ad-
 vanced to fight. But what'could sticks and spears or a
 score or two of muskets do before the cannon&rsquo;s mouth ?
 The children were soon defeated and dispersed.
