 did not exceed five cubits. In rounding her capacious
 waist it was almost run out. Then again the nakedness
 of the body had also to be covered with it. Thus far the
 cloth would go, but on reaching the shoulder it refused
 to go further, and when the ear was reached it absolgtely
 stood still. So the very modest Gouri Thakurani had
 to content herself with holding the skirt of her cloth
 near the ear and, resolving to provide herself in future
 with cloths 8 cubits long, she answered, " Hallo, Gossain,
 come, come ; but why do you bow to me ?&rdquo;

 me, if you choose, for in any case I am older than you.&rdquo;

 are so droll, and don&rsquo;t you know when we made the

 the intention to remarry you one day with the permis-
 tion of the head of our abbey.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'For shame, you must not say that,&rsquo;&rsquo; said! Gouri,
 'you know I am a widow.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'Then there won&rsquo;t be a remarriage ?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 "Do what you think best, you are a wise man and
 I am a poor woman&mdash;what can I know ? well, when
 is it going to take place then ?&rdquo;
