                             Prefatary Note
THOUGH not exactly the originator of Bengali prose litera-
 ture, Bankim Chandra, more than any other single person
 is entitled to the name of the Father of Bengali prose. Before
 him the efforts of Bengali prose literature were in the nature
 of experiments in style and trials of its powers and resources.
 It was he who for the first time struck out for himself a path
 in the matter of style to which Bengali literature has clung
 since then with the utmost profit to itself. He tapped the
 real source of its greatest strength and opened out a glorious
 vista which Bengali literature has since then gone on making
 its own.
     The writings of Bankim Chandra Chatterji first disclosed
 the vast capabilities of the Bengali language. He showed that
 it could be simple and natural but not vulgar, and solemn
 and serious but not stilted, and with his complete mastery
 over the language he demonstrated unmistakeably how it was
 capable of expressing all shades of feeling and thought with
 force and brilliance and with a variety of expression that
 came from its association with the rich Sanskrit vocabulary
 on the one hand and the vocabulary of a quick-witted cultured
 and resourceful people&rsquo;s dialect on the other. Both these
 sources of strength and versatility Bankim Chandra utilised
 with the utmost advantage, and the result was a style of
Bengali prose which by its superior charm and elegance, as
 well as by its facile expression, has outlived the tentative styles
 that flourished before him and has set the motel for Bengali
 prose ever since.
