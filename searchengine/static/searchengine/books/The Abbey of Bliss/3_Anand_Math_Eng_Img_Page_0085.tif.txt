CHAPTER 63
 the villagers had managed to keep body and soul
 together.
 Within a mango grove stood a little house. It was
 made up of four huts surrounded by a mud wall. The
 owner of the house had a cow, a goat, a peacock, a myna
 an d a parrot. He had had a monkey too, but had let
 it off as he could feed it no Longer. He had a husking
 mill, a granary and a lemon tree in the yard, with some
 malika and jasmine trees which had no flowers this
 year. On the veranda of each hut stood a spinning
 wheel. There were not many people in the house however.
 This was the house Jivananda entered with the child.
 On entering the house Jivananda began to make
 a horrid noise with a spinning wheel. The little
 girl had never in her life heard such noise. She was
 weeping since she had left her mother, and now began to
 cry Iustily. Then a girl of seventeen or eighteen sum-
 mers came out of the room and putting the forefinger
 of her right hand on her cheek she bent her head and
 stood watching in wonder ; &lsquo;La ! it&rsquo;s your brother ! why,
 what are you working the wheel for ? Where could
 you get the girl ? Is it yours ? Have you got one ? Have
 you married again ?&rdquo; she asked mischievously.
 Jivananda threw the child into her arms, showed
 her his fist, and said : &lsquo;] You wicked wench, how dare
 you speak of my daughter. Am I a man to trifle
 with 7 Now go and see if you have got milk in the house.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The girl answered :&lsquo;&rsquo;Yes, I have ; would you take
 some ?&rdquo; &lsquo;&rsquo; Yes,&rsquo;&rsquo; replied Jivananda most seriously.
