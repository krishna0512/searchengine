 the soft rumble of the rivulet running on its bed of
 sands. There was also the green wood, the green earth,
 the limpid stream running by, the white sandbed
 spread out and blooming flowers smiling. At intervals
 rose the song " Hail, mother," so pleasing to everybody.
 Satyananda then appeared and stood before the
 assembly of the Children. The heads of ten thousand
Children were forthwith lowered to the ground, illumined
 by the moonbeams straggling through interstices of the
 leaves. With his hands raised to the sky and with tears
 glistening in his eyes, Satyananda spoke at the top of
 his voice : "The Lord of Baikuntha, who wears the gar-
 land of wild flowers and holds the Conch, the Disc, the
 Club and the Lotus, who killed the demon Kesi and
 slew Madhu, Mur and Naraka, May He bless you, give
 you strength in your arms, devotion in your heart
 and Inspire you to piety. You just sing His glory first.&rdquo;
 Then the ten thousends voices sang :&mdash;
         "When deluge sank the worlds,
             On the water endless,
        Vedas thou didst uphold
            Like a frigate fearless.&mdash;
        O Lord of worlds that wore
            The form of Fish of Yore.&rsquo;&rsquo; 
   Satyananda blessed them again and said : &ldquo;Children,
 to-day I have something particular to tell you. An
 unbeliver and miscreant named Thomas has killed
 many of our flock. Tonight we shall distroy him
With his entire force. This is the Lord&rsquo;s command&mdash;
 what say you to this ?&rdquo;
