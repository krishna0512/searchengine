                                     CHAPTER V                          137
"You went to see her ?"
"Well, and then ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&lsquo;You are greatly enamoured of the damsel.&rdquo;
 Bhavananda mused a while and said : " Dhirananda,
 why did you seek to know so much ? Every word of what
 you say is true. How many other than yourself know it ?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;No one but myself.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"Then I can save my good name only if I kill you ?&rdquo;
" You can.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &ldquo;Then come let us fight in this solitude. Either
 I shall kill you and be easy myself or you will kill me
 and mark an end of all my troubles. Are you armed ?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Certainly ; who would dare talk to you of these
 things unarmed ? If fight be your object, I. am in for
 it. A fight between two Children is forbidden, but
 there is no prohibition against fighting for self-defence.
 But would it not be much better to begin the fight after
 I have said ail that I had to say ?&rsquo;&rsquo;
"There&rsquo;s no harm in that ; go on,&rdquo; said Bhavananda,
 and taking his sword out of the scabbard placed it on
 Dhirananda&rsquo;s shoulder, lest he should fly.
 &ldquo;I was going to say, yon had better marry Kalyani,&rdquo;
 said Dhirananda.
 &lsquo;'Kalyani ! You even know the name ?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 "Why don&rsquo;t you marry her ?&rdquo;
"She has got a husband.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"Oh, Vaishnava&rsquo;a do marry like that !"
"That is for the low-class men and not for the
Children&mdash;a Child can never marry.&rdquo;
