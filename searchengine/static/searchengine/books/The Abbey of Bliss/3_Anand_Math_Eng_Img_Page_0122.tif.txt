" I am afraid not&mdash;it seems all so new to me, Once
 I met a Christian priest at Cassimbazar ; he said some-
 thing like it :&mdash;God is Love, he said, and wanted us to
 love Jesus. It is all very much like that.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;I have only tried to make yon understand whAt
 our ancestors have all along believed in. Have you
 ever heard that the Deity consists of three Gunas ?&rdquo;
"I have ;Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are the three
 attributes of the Lord.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &lsquo;&lsquo;All right, these three gunas have got to be pro-
 pitiated by distinct modes of worship. From Sattva
 springs God&rsquo;s mercy and love and this is to be propitiated
 by Love.&mdash;That&rsquo;s what the followers of Chaitanya do.
 From Rajas springs His Power,&mdash;this has got to be
 propitiated by fight, by slaying the enemies of the
 gods. This is what we do. From Tamas the Lord
 takes what form he chooses and appears as the four-
 handed Deity and other gods. This is to be worshipped
 by garlands, sandal, &amp;c. This is what the ordinary
 man does, Do you understand now ?&rsquo;
" I do ; then the Children are only a religious com-
 munity ?"
 &ldquo;Quite so, we do not want sovereignty ; we only
 want to kill these Mussulmans, root and branch, be-
 cause they have become the enemies of God.&rdquo;
