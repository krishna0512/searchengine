CHAPTER  XII         105
 So saying Satyananda pulled at the long jet black
 beards of his disciple and the false beards forthwith
 came off.
"For shame, child,&rdquo; said Satyananda,  "how could
 you think of deceiving me ? And if you did, why did you
 hang such long beards at this age. Even if you had
 your beards shorter, could you dissemble that voice and
 look ? If I were such a fool as that, I could not have
 taken such a great work in hand.&rdquo;
 Santi&mdash;impudent thing&mdash;first hid her eyes with her
 hand and looked down. But presently she took away
 the hand and, looking in the face of the shrewd old
 man with her sportive glance, said,  "But sire, what
 is there wrong in what I have done ? Can strength
 never reside in a woman&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&lsquo;Aye, even as you have water in a cow&rsquo;s foot-print.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Do you ever try the strength of the Children."
 &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Satyananda and brought out a steel bow
 and a bit of wire. "They have got to put this string to
 the stee! bow,&rdquo; he continued,  "the string is only three
 feet long. The bow springs up with the attempt to
 bend it and throws oft the attempter. He who can
 string it is a really strong man,&rdquo;
 Santi carefully examined the bow and string, and
 asked " Have all the Children passed the test.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;No, I have only tried their strength by its means.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&lsquo;Has no one passed ?&ldquo;
 &lsquo;'Only four have.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &ldquo;May I ask who they are ?&rdquo;
