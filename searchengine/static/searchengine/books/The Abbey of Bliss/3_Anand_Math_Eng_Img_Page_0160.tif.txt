134  THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 to your charms. I did not know that there was ever such
 a beauty on earth. If I knew that I would have to meet
 with snch a beauty, I would never have adopted the
 Children's creed. In the fire of thy beauty the creed gets
 burnt to ashes. My religion has been consumed by
 thy charms, only life exists. Even the life itself has
 been burning out these four years, Kalyani, I am daily
 passing through an ordeal of fire;&mdash;I am being
 scalded through and through. But the fuel for the fire
 is all but run out. My days now can be numbered.
 I have borne it for four years, I cannot bear it any
 more. Kalyani, will you be mine ?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 K. &ldquo;I have heard from your Iips that it is a
 rule of the Children&rsquo;s creed that he who is swayed by
 passions has got to expiate the sin by death. Is it true ?&rdquo;
 " It is.&rsquo;
 &lsquo;"Then you have to expiate this by death ?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &lsquo; Yes, that is the only expiation possible.&rdquo;
  " Will you die if I fulfil your desire ?&rdquo;
 " Yes, I will.&rdquo;
 "If I don't?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &ldquo;Even then I must die, for my heart has been a
 slave to the passions.&rdquo;
 "I will not satisfy thy desire ; when will thou die ?&rdquo;
 "In the coming fight.&rdquo;
 "Then get thee gone,&rdquo; said Kalyani, " will you send
 me my daughter ?&rdquo; With tears in his eyes, Bhavananda
 answered &ldquo; I will ; but tell me, will you remember me
 when I am dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;
