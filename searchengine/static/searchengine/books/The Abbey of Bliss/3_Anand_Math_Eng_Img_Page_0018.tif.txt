Author&rsquo;s Preface to the First Edition.
 The wife of the Bengalee is very often his chief
 support : sometimes also she is not.
Revolutions are very generally processes of self-tor-
 ture and rebels are suicides,
 The English have saved Bengal from anarchy.
 These truths are elucidated in this work.
 Author&rsquo;s Preface to the Third Edition.
 This time the true history of the Sannyasi Rebellion
 has been given in extracts from English works in the
 Appendix. The reader will see that it was a very
 serious affair.
 He will also see that there is some difference
 between a history and a novel, The battles described
 in the novel did not really happen in Birbhum but
 in Northern Bengal. And, in the novel, the name of
 Major Wood has been used in the place of Captain
 Edwards. This difference I do not consider essential,
 for the novel is a novel and not history.
 Author&rsquo;s Preface to the Fifth Edition.
 It was found unnecessary to retain the differences
 referred to in the preface to the third edition and the
 necessary emendations have been made in the present
 edition. There hag been alterations in some other
 respects also. Santi has been made a little gentler and
 the part of her life which was left to the reader to guess
 in previous editions has been explicitly set forth in a
 fresh chapter.
