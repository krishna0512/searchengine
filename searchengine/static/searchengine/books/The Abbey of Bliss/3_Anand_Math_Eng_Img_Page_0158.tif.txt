 Can he run who has got iron chains on his legs ? O,

 'A wife is the participator in her husband&rsquo;s duties
 and an aid to their performance.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &lsquo;'That applies to the humdrum duties of life, but in
 all high and noble works the wife is a thorn on her
 husband&rsquo;s path. A thorn is drawn out by a thorn alone,
 they say, I sought to pluck the thorn of his failure in
 duty by the thorn of poison. For shame, you wretched
 and sinful ascetic, why did you give me back my life ?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &lsquo;'Well, let what I have given remain mine. Kalyani,
 could yoh give me back the life that I have given you ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'Do you know how my daughter Sukumari is ?
 &lsquo;&ldquo;I have not heard of her for a long time. Jiva-

 K. Could you not get me news of her ? My husband
 I must give up, but, if I have lived, why should I give
 up my daughter too ? If I get back Sukumari, even in
 this hapless life of mine, I may yet then have some joy.
 But no, why should you do all this for me ?&rdquo;
 B. I will do it for you, Kalyani, I will get you your
 child, but what then ?
 K. What then ?
 B. What of your husband ?
