112                  THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 humble submission is that your worship will please in-
 timate why your worship has come to this poor
 man&rsquo;s hut from Bharuipur.&rdquo;
" I don&rsquo;t see there is any occasion for ridicule either.
 I don&rsquo;t know Bharuipur. I came here today to adopt the
 creed of the Children and have been initiated to-day.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"Good gracious ! Is it true ?&rdquo;
"Why, what&rsquo;s the harm ? you too are initiated.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 'But you are a woman.&rdquo;
"How&rsquo;s it  Where could you get that ? &rdquo;
" I thought that my consort was a female.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;' Consort ! have you one ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'I thought I had.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'You believe then that I am your wife.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 Jivananda again played the penitent by throwing the
 skirt round his neck and, joining his palms, said:
 &lsquo;'So I do, worshipful sir.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'If such a ludicrous idea should have possessed your
 mind, what do you think you ought to do ?"
 &ldquo;To take the deerskin off your body and to drink
 the honey of your lips.&rdquo;
 This is only an evidence of your mischievous turn of
 mind or of an unusual devotion to hemp. At the time
 of initiation you swore not to sit on the same seat
 with a woman. If you do really take me for a woman
 &mdash;and indeed people do often make such mistakes,
 for instance, when a rope is, mistaken tor a snake&mdash;then
 you ought to sit on a separate seat. Even talking with
 me is not meet for you.&rdquo;
