"We also shall not make any distinction and shall

"Then I shall initiate you. Never break the vow
 you have taken here. Vishnu Himself is witness to it.
He who slew Ravana,Kamsa, Hiranyakasipu, Jarasan-
dha, Sisupala and others, who knows he inmost
 thoughts of everybody, who is all-victor, all-powerful
 and all-regulator, who dwells alike in the thunderbolt
 of Indra and in the claws of the cat, He will send the
 breaker of faith to eternal perdition.&rdquo;
"So be it,&rdquo; they said.
"Sing then &rsquo;Hail mother,&rdquo; said the monk and
 the two sang the hymn of the Mother. The monk
 then initiated them in proper form.
