"That&rsquo;s not what I should ask you to do,&rdquo; she
 replied. "We can no more be householders. We shall
 be ascetics like this for ever and keep for ever the vow
 of virginity. Come, let us now go about visiting the
 shrines.&rsquo;&rsquo;

 Jivananda.

 Himalayas, worship our God, and ask for the blessing
 that good may be our Mother&rsquo;s share.&rdquo;

 eternity it would seem&mdash;in the dead of that moonlit
 night,
 Oh Mother ! would they come again ? Would you
 ever bear again a son like Jivananda and a daughter
 like Santi ?
