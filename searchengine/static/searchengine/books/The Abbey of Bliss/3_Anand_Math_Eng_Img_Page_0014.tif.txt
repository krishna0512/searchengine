 for the provincialism in his patriotism, it is difficult to believe
 that Bamkim Chandra was a stranger to the idea of greater
 nationality which is the goal of cultured Indians of today.
The explanation is rather to be sought in his romantic tem-
 perament which was deeply stirred by it, as much as was that of
 Sir Waltet Scott by the parochial patriotism of his Highlanders
 and by the Scottish patriotism which even now makes itself
felt in after-dinner orations in the St. Andrews Dinner.
 As to the religious tone of his patriotism he perceived that
 the strongest sentiment of the Indian, as well as the most
 pronounced element in the Eastern civilisation, is the religious
 sentiment. To acclamatise Western culture in the Eastern
 soil then, we have to dip it full in the well of spiritual-
 ism. Nothing in Western cuiture can take root in the
 East unless it is inspired with the religious sentiment. The
 attempt to bring about this synthesis led him, not only to
 imbue patriotic sentiments with religion but also conceive
 nationality itself under the category of religion. He evidently
 thought that the only nationality India was capable of was a
 religious nationality ;&mdash;the sentiment probably which inspires
 people who talk about a Hindu Nation and a Mussulman Nation
 in the same Indian soil. To say the least, such an idea is
 absurd. We must have one Indian nation or no nation at all.
 Sectarian sentiments are ill dignified by being named in the
 lofty vocabulary of patriotism.
Two very sinister consequences are seen to flow from this
 conception of a religious basis of nationality in the present
 work. The first is the attempt to rehabilitate the Hindu
 Pantheon with new-fangled patriotic gods and goddesses, and
 tho second is the morbid dislike of Mussuhnans that seems to
he indicatcd in this work. Neither would seem to be the least
