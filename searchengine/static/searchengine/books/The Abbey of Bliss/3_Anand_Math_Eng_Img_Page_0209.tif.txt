 The two then had a short deliberation in whispers:
 which done, Jivananda hid himself in a thicket. Santi
 entered another and engaged herself in a fine fun.
 She was going to die, but she had determined to
 die in a woman&rsquo;s dress. As Mahendra had told her, her
 male costume was a mask and she could not carry it on
 to death. So he had brought out with her the basket
 which contained her toilette an - womanly dress.
 Having put on her smart nose-print with a little
 catechu patch between the eye-brows and covering her
 blooming face with fine short curls after the fashion of the
 day, Santi equipped herself with a sareng and appeared
 in the guise of a singing Vaishnavi girl in the camp of
 the Englishmen. Her sight upset the sepoys in their
 jet black beards and moustache. Some bid her sing
 love songs, some would have Ghuzl, others asked songs
 to Kali and other again would hear about Krishna.
 Some gave her rice, some dal, some sweets, some pice
 and some again four-anna pieces. The Vaishnavi then
 carefully informed herself of the state of the camp and
 was about to leave, when the sepoys asked her as to
 when she was going to pay them another visit.
 &lsquo;'Can&rsquo;t say,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;' I live at a great dis-
 tance.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;' How far ?,&rsquo; asked they.
 ! I live at Padachinha,&rdquo; was the answer.
