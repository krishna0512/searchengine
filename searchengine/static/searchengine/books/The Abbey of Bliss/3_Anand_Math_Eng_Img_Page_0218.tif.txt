 followed their example, and they were joined by others&mdash;
 there was a great uproar. Jivananda had in the mean-
 time entered the ranks of the enemy, and they saw him
 no more.
 The rest of the Children now saw that some of them
 were returning. Every one thought that the Children
 must have won the fight. The whole army therefore
 turned round and rushed upon the English force.
 Among the Englisn forces too there was a great
 confusion. The sepoys were forsaking the fight and
 running away, the English soldiers too were making for
 their camp with their arms. Looking round for an
 explanation Mahendra found, on the summit of the hill,
 a large contingent of Children rushing down the hill on
 the English from behind, He then called out to his
 soldiers: ' Children, look, there is Master Satyananda&rsquo;s
 flag. The Lord Incarnate himself, the slayer of demons
 and wicked men, have come to the fight. Myriads of
 Children are on the hill. Say &lsquo;Hare,Murare&rsquo; and crush
 the Mussulman force from both sides."
 The woods and wilds were then deeply stirred with
 their loud shout in reaponse. The weapons of the
 Children mixed their clatter with the sonnd of the palm
 leaves waved by the wind ; Mahendra&rsquo;s army proudly
 mounted the hill and like stream turned back by a rock
 the State forces were stunned, disturbed and struck
 with fear. Satyananda, in the meanwhile, with his
 twenty-five thousand Children, fell upon them like the
 rushing sea and a tremendous fight ensued.
