                             CHAPTER V
 Within this wood there stood a large monastery on
 a large piece of land with broken stones all around.
 Antiquarians would perhaps say that it was a Buddhist
 monastery in old days and was subsequently con-
 verted into a Hindu one. The buildings were two-storied.
 Within them were many temples and in front was a
 canopied yard. Most of the buildings were surrounded
 by walls and so shaded by trees outside that one would
 not think there was a building here, even if one looked
 in the daylight and from close quarters. The buildings
 were broken at many places but you could see by day-
 light that those places had been repaired of late. From
 the very sight of those buildings you could at once
 infer that there was human habitation within this deep
 inaccessible forest, In one of the rooms of this abbey
 a big log was burning, and as Kalyani first regained her
 conscioness in it, she saw before her, the great man of
 hoary hue, with milk-white garments on ! Kalyani
 looked again with surprise, for she could not recollect
 things yet. Then the great man said, " Mother, this
 is a place of the gods, you need not be afraid. There
 is a little milk there, drink that and then I shall speak
 to you.&rdquo;
 Kalyani understood nothing at first. Then as she
 grew a little steady, she took the skirt of her cloth
 round her neck and bowed herself before the great man.
