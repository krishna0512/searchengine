182    THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 Now, the Major had on that day been trying to get
 some informations about Padachinha, and this one of
 the sepoys knew. He took the Vaishnavi to the Captain
 and the Captain took her to the Major. Before the
Major, the Vaishnavi smiled a maddening smile and
 casting a wistful glance at him that pierced his heart,
 she struck her small tambourine and sang the sans-
 krit song t
"To lay the Mlechha low with the sword relentless."
 The Major asked her in broken Bengali, : "Where do
 you live, Bibi.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;I am not a Bibi but a Vaishnavi ; I live at Pada-
 chinha.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"Well, that is Padsin, Padsin is it ?" said the Cap-
 tain in English, and then continued in Hindi, " is there
 a gurh there ?"
&ldquo;Ghar ? Oh, there are plenty of ghars."1
 &ldquo;No, no, not ghar but gurh, gurh ! &rdquo; said the
 Major. Yet so were the words pronounced that there was
 absolutely no distinction between the two,
"I understand what you mean,&rdquo; said Santi, ' you
 mean gurh ?&rdquo;
"Yes, yes, gurh, gurh, is there a gurh ?&rdquo;
"Oh yes, a great fort.&rdquo;
"How many men ?&rdquo;
"You mean how many men live there ? Oh, it is
 about 20 or 50 thousand.&rdquo;
Gurh is a fort.
Ghar is a house.
