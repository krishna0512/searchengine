 Santi did so&mdash;there was nothing to be felt. The saint
 said : &ldquo;See again, put your finger into the mouth and
 see if there is any warmth there.&rdquo; Santi did as she
 was bid and answered " I cannot quite feel if there is.&rdquo;
 She had been lured into a half-belief by hope.
 The saint touched the body with his left hand and
 said : &ldquo;You have been stunned by fear and can&rsquo;t feel it.
 I think some heat is left yet in the body. Feel once
 again.&rdquo;
 Santi again felt the pulse and found that it was
 stirring. Astonished, she put her hand on the breast,&mdash;
 the heart was beating. She felt tor the breath and
 found that there was some motion. There wvas also
some warmth in the mouth. she was astonished and
 said, &lsquo;' Was life really left or has it come anew ?&rdquo;
"That can never be,&rdquo; "he answered ; "could you
 carry him to the bank of the pond there. I am a
 physician, I shall treat him."
 Santi carried Jivananda with ease and took him to
 the water. The physician said ; Take him to the tank
 and wash a way the blood. I am coming with some
 medicine.&rdquo; Santi did as she was bid and the physician
 shortly arrived with a paste made of wild plants and
 creepers. He applied the preparation to the sores and
 then passed his hand over Jivananda&rsquo;s body for some
 time. Jivananda then sat up with a sigh and asked
 Santi : "Who have won the fight ?&rdquo;
"Yours has been the victory,&rsquo;&rsquo; replied Santi : "Make
 your obeisance to this great man.&rdquo;
