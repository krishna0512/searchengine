                                CHAPTER XV                     65
      &ldquo;What will you do with her ?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &ldquo;I will feed her, nurse her, fondle her&rsquo;&mdash;the wretched
 tears would come again. Nimi wiped them off again
 and smiled. " What will you do with it  You will
 have many children, &rdquo; said Jivananda.
 Doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rsquo; said Nimi, &lsquo;'let me have her for
 sometime at least. You may take her away later on.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Keep her then, and go to the dogs with her, I shall
 come and see her now and then. She is a Kayestha&rsquo;s
 daughter, mind. Now I am off.&rdquo;
   "What ! going ? Won&rsquo;t you take anything ? The
 day is far advanced and you mustn&rsquo;t go without your
 meal, You&rsquo;ll eat my head if you do.&rsquo;&rsquo;*
     "To eat thy head and some food to boot ! Both of
 these I can&rsquo;t, dear sister. Do just spare the head and
 give me a dish of rice iI you please.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 Nimi then busied herself in getting up the dish for
 her brother with the child in her arms.
 She then placed a plank to sit on and cleaned a yard
 or two of ground with water she had sprinkled before.
 She then brought her brother some clean, jasmine-white
 rice, some tasteful dal, a curry of wild figs, some fish
 metted from her own tank and some milk. As he sat
 down to eat, Jivananda said : &ldquo;I say Nimi, sister, who
 says there&rsquo;s famine here ? In your village you don&rsquo;t seem
 to have it,&rsquo;&rdquo;
 This is a common imprecation which affectionate people&mdash;females
 particularly&mdash;always use as a means of persuasion.
