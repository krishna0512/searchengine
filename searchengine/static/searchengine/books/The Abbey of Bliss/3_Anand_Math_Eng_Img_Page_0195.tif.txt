 been defeated and the country has come back to
 the Hindus; cry Hari, Hari.&rdquo; The villagers would chase
 any Mussulman that they would meet&mdash;some would
 combine and go to the Mussalman quarters to
 set fire to their houses and pillage them. Many
 Moslems shaved of their beards, smeared their bodies
 with earth and sung Harinam. When challenged, they
 would say in their own patois that they were Hindus.
 The terrified Mussulmans flew to the city in large

 themselves to mount guard with care. All men kept awake
