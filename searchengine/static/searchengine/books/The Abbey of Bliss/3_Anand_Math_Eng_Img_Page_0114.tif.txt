 and with the other covered her breast. There was a
 little mirror in the room ; Santi recovered it from its
 long exile and looked well at her dress in it. "Alas,&rdquo;
 said she, as she looked at it, "How am I to cover these ?&rdquo;
 She then threw away the glass and took up the hair
 she had cut off and made them up into false beards and
 moustaches. But she could not put them on. "For shame,&rdquo;
 she thought, &ldquo;those days are gone and I cannot do it any
 more. But it is good to have it at hand to give a
 lesson to the old fellow.&rdquo; She then took out a large deer-
 skin and tied it to her neck covering with it the whole of
 her front up to the knees. Thus dressed, this new san-
 nyasin looked on all sides from within the room. When
 it was midnight Santi emerged from her house in the
 dark and entered the deep forest. The nymphs of the
 wood heard at dead of night the following song sung in
 melodious strains :
&ldquo;Trotting on horseback where dost thou go ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&lsquo;I go to the battle, tell me not&mdash;&lsquo;no&rsquo; !
 Hari, Hari, Hari, so shall I cry,
 And spring to the fight prepared to die I
 Who art thou ? Who&rsquo;s thine ? Why follow me
 Victory ! O woman, I care not for thee !
"Prithee my dearest don&rsquo;t leave behind
Thy bride so suffering, be thou O kind !"
"Hark thee ! The music; victory it sings,
 Thirsting for battle my war-horse it springs.
 At home my mind, O, no more would be
 Victory ! O woman, I care not for thee!&rdquo;
