Chapter 11
 When Santi left her house at dead of night and left
 for the town, Jivananda was present there. She told him:
 &ldquo;I am going to town to get Mahendra&rsquo;s wife. You
 just tell him that his wife lives."
 Jivananda had heard from Bhavananda all about
 his saving Kalyani&rsquo;s life and he had heard of her present
 whereabouts from Santi who was wont to travel to all
 places. By and by he told all this to Mahendra.
 Mahendra could not believe it at first and then he
 was overpowered with joy.
 Next morning Mahendra and Kalyani met through
 the good offices of Santi. Before the birds and beasts
 had risen from their sleep, they met each other in that
 still forest, under the dark shade of the thickly-placed
sal  trees. There was none to witness the meeting, save
 the pale stars on the azure sky and the steady and
 endless line of trees. Afar there was the sweet murmur
 of some small rumbling stream that sang with the
 touch of pebbles, and anon there was the stray
 dooing of an early cuckoo, delighted with the glow on
 the crest of Dawn shining in the east.
 When it was one prahar after daybreak, Jivananda
 and Santi appeared there. Kalyani said to Santi : &ldquo;We
 are sold as slaves to you for the service you have
 One prahar is about three hours.
