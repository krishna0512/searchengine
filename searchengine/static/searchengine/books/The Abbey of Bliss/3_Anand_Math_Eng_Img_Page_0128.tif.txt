Chapter VII
 When Mahendra left after making his obeisance, the
 sccond man who was initiated with him came up and
 bowed before the monk. Satyananda blessed him and
 ordered him to sit on the black deerskin seat that lay
 there. He spoke pleasantly to him for some time and
 then said : &rsquo;' How now, is your love and devotion for
 Sri krishna strong enough ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&ldquo;How can I say ? May be what I call love and devotion
 is either hypocrisy or self-deception.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Yon have spoken well,&rdquo; said Satyananda, &ldquo; engage
 Yourself in such acts as will tend to increase your
 devotion and I bless thee that thou mayest succced in
 thy endeavours. For you are yet ot a tender age. Child,
 I have not yet asked you by what name I may call you.&rdquo;
 The new Child said, "As your holiness pleases, I am
 the seruvs  servorum of the Vaishnavas.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Looking at your youth I am disposed to christen
 you with the name of Nabinananda ; by this name you
 shall be known in our society. But I wish to ask
 you  one thing ; what was your old name ? You may
 tell it to me even if there is any bar. It won&rsquo;t reach
 another&rsquo;s ear if yom confide it to me, It is a tenet of the
 creed of The Children that you have to speak to the
 master  what you may not speak to anybody else. There
 is no harm in telling it.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&ldquo;My name is Santiram Devasarma.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'Your name is Mrs, Santimane  What !'!
