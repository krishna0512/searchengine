 After that Satyananda, Jivananda, Mahendra,
 Nabinananda and Dhirananda sat down in the wvood
 to deliberate. " The object with which we had so long
 renounced all pleasures and all other duties has been
 gained. There is no longer any inficdel force in this
 part of the country. What remains of it will not be able
 to stand for a moment before us. What do you now
 advise us to do ?&rdquo;
 Jivananda answered, "Let us now go and attack
 the capital.&rdquo;
"That is my opinion too,&rdquo; said Satyananda.
"Where is the army for it ?&rdquo;, asked Jivananda.
J. " Why, these soldiers of ours ?"
D." Where are 'these soldiers ?&rsquo; Whom do you
 see here ?&rsquo;
J. They are resting at places. They will all comc
 at the beat of our drum.
D. You won&rsquo;t find any one of them now.
 "Why ?" inquired Satyananda.
 D. They are all out looting. The villages are unpro-
 tected now. They will now pillage the Mussulman villages
 and the silk-factory and return home. You will not find
 any one now. I have searched for them everywhere.
 Satyananda wyrs sorry but said : " However, this part
 or the country has come under our sway. There is no
 one here weho ctn dispute our sovereignty. So you will
 now declare the Children&rsquo;s rule in the land of the
Barendras. Levy taxes from the people and recruit an
 army for an atttck on the city. Good many soldiers
