 worship, to Whom I daily bow and trusting Whom I
 could enter even this wild forest ? Where art thou, O
 Madhusudan.&rdquo; Kalyani was weak with hunger and
 thirst, and now from the intense fervour of her devotion,
 she slowly lost all physical sensations and in her inner
 consciousness she heard in space a heavenly voice
 chanting the various favourite names of Vishnu.
 From childhood Kalyani had heard in Puranas that
 the heavenly saint Narada wandered over the world
 chanting the divine name of Hari to the accompaniment
 of his harp. That vision was now conjured up in her mind.
 Inly she saw the colossal figure of the great saint, with
 a complexion of faultless white and with flowing white
 locks and beards, passing in his white garments through
 the azure sky, lit with silver moonbeams and singing the
 name of God to the accompaniment of the Vina.
 Slowly the music drew nearer and became more
 audible. It drew nearer and grew clearer still, till at
 last the song rang the woods to the echo just over her
 head.
 Kalyani then opened her eyes, In the misty moon-
 light of the woods she saw standing before her the
 elorious form of the hoary saint with a complexion
 of faultless white, and with milk-white garments on,
 his hair and beards flowing in waves of snow. Halt
 dreaming, she thought she would bow her head to him,
 but as she lowered her head to make her salute she
tell senseless on the ground.
