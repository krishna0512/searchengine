CHAPTER VII                                    193
 searched the whole Field, but could nowhere find what
 she wanted. She then threw down the torch, dropped
 herself on the ground smeared with blood and spread
 with dead bodies and wept bitterly. It was Santi ; she
 was looking for Jivananda&rsquo;s body.
 She was thus weeping when a sweet and gentle voice
 reached her ear ; somebody said, &lsquo;"Rise, mother, do not
 weep.&rdquo; Santi looked up and saw standing before her
 in the moonlight the wonderful ignore of a saint with
 a head full or clotted hair.
 Santi stood up, The saint said : &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t weep,
 mother. I shall look out Jivananda&rsquo;s body for you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Then the great man took Santi to the middle of the
 field where innumerable dead bodies were thrown upon
 one another in a heap. Santi had not been able to re-
 move them all. That most powerful man removed the
 heap of the dead and dragged out one. Santi knew
 that it was Jivananda&rsquo;s body, scarred with wounds and
 smeared with blood. Santi cried aloud like a common
woman,
 He said, "Don&rsquo;t weep mother. Are you sure
 Jivananda is dead r Just examine his body with care.
 First feel the pulse.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 Santi felt the pulse, there was not the slightest
 quickness in it. The saint said, &lsquo;"Feel the chest with
 your touch.&rsquo; Santi did it but there was no beating there,
 all was cold.
 He then said, 'Feel the nostrils and see if there is
 the slightest breath."
