116                    THE ABBEY OF BLISS
set fire to their houses. While the Mussulmans busied
 themselves in saving their lives, the Children plundered
 their possessions and distributed them among their
 followers. When the rustics were gratified with a share
 of the booty, they were taken to the temple of Vishnu
 and initiated there as Children with the touch of the
 idol&rsquo;s feet. People found that the Children&rsquo;s mission was
 a lucrative business. Besides, they were intensely dis-
 affected with the anarchy and misrule of Mussulman
 domination. Many people were really anxious to revive
 Hinduism on seeing that it was gradually sinking. So
 the ranks of the Children daily swelled. Hundreds came
 every day and thousands every month and, bowing to
 the feet of Jivananda and Bhavananda, went out in
 companies to different quarters to punish the Mussul-
 mans. Where they found officials they beat them, and
 sometimes even killed them ; where they found public
 money they plundered it ; and where they found a
 Mussulman habitation they burnt it down to ashes.
 The local officials then began to send out large
 detachments of the army. But now the Children were
 a compact body, well armed and proud of their
 strength. The Mussulmans could not approach them
 for their prowess, When they did, the puissant Children
 fell on them, worked havoc in their ranks and
 cried "Hari, Hari.&rdquo; I f ever a Mussulman detach-
 ment defeated the Children, another body of Children
 would forthwith tarn up and cut oft the heads of
 the erstwhile victors and go away shouting &ldquo;Hari.
