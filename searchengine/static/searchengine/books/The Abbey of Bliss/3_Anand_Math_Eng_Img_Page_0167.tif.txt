 the Bhagirathi.*  The body may come to dust in a
Mnoment and with it the senses,&mdash;and I have been borne
away by these ! Death is best for me now-breaker of
a vow that I am. Die ! fie ! why shall I die s&rsquo; Just at
 that time the owl grimly screeched overhead. Bhava-
 nanda then spoke oat : "What&rsquo;s that 3 It sounded in
 my ears as a call from Death. I do not know who
made the sound, who called me, who gave me the
 advice, who bade me die ! Infinity ! Thou art full of
 sounds, but I know not the meaning of thy voice. Give
me a mind to do my duty, keep me a way from sin.
 Oh, my Master ! bless me, that I may ever walk in the
 path of Duty.&rsquo;
     Then, from the woods, a deep and sweet human
 voice,cried out, &lsquo;" I bless thee, thou shall ever walk on
 the path of duty.&rdquo;
 Bhavananda shuddered, " What is that,&rdquo; he cried,
"it is my Master&rsquo;s voice. Maharaj, where are you, come
 before your slave in his distress.&rdquo;
    But no one appeared, no one made a reply.
 Bhavananda called again and again but no answer
 came. He looked about on all sides but no one was
 there.
  Bhavananda returned to the Abbey at about dawn.
 The morning sun washed the green leaves on the top
 " This refers to the legend that when the holy Ganges or the Bhagi-
 rathi was rushing down the plains, following her guide Bhagirath, a
 huge elephant who was much puffed up with pride took it into its head to
 stop the flow of the current. It therefore stood in front of the torrent,
 prepared to fight, and was carried away like a straw.
