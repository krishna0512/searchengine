 Santi could not speak for some time. She then
 slowly said, &ldquo;For shame, my love ! You are a hero and
 my greatest pride in life is that I am a hero&rsquo;s spouse.
 You will forsake the hero&rsquo;s duty for the petty sake of
 the trifle that a woman is ! Do not love me&mdash;I do not
 want the pleasure,&mdash;but grant me this that you will
 never swerve from the path of a hero&rsquo;s duty. But do
 tell me one thing before you go. What have you got
 to do to expiate this transgression ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'Well, a trifle&mdash;fasting, a gift of 12 Kahans of
 cowrie.&rdquo;
 Santi smiled and said, "I know what it is ; now, is the
 expiation the same for many faults as for one ?&rdquo;
 Jivananda was startled and asked in distress :"What
 do you mean by this ?&rdquo;
 'I have got a prayer to make&mdash;do not make the
 expiation before you see me again.&rdquo;
 Jivananda smiled. ' You needn&rsquo;t fear that &rdquo; he said,
"I could not die before seeing you. In fact I am in
 no hurry to die. I won&rsquo;t stay here longer, I cannot have
 my ill of looking at you now, but I am sure I will have
 the opportunity some day. Our desire will one day be
 fulfilled. I will go now ; but you must keep one request
 from me&mdash;you must give up this dress and go and live
 in my ancestral home.&rdquo;
