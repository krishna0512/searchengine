                           CHAPTER XIII                                        55
 place with a passe of sepoys. Without the slightest
 hesitation he put his hand on Satyananda&rsquo;s neck and
 cried out : &lsquo;&rsquo; This rogue is a sannyasi.&rdquo; Another caught
 Mahendra at the same time ; for, in sooth, as his
 associate he must also be a sannyasi himself. Another
 again was making for Kalyani&rsquo;s body which was
 stretched on the grass ; but he found that it was the
 corpse of a female and might not be a sannyasi for
 aught he knew&mdash;and left her. He left the child too,
 thinking likewise. Without another word they then
 bound up the two and prepared to carry them away,&mdash;
Kalyani&rsquo;s body and her daughter lay there under a
 tree without any body to take care of them.
 Mahendra was first stupefied with grief and only half-
 conscious in his ecstasy. He could not quite under-
 stand what was going on and did not object to being
 tied up. But as he went a few steps, he suddenly real-
 ised that they had been taken prisoners. No sooner
 did the thought strike him that Kalyani&rsquo;s body lay
 there uncremated, that his child was left behind
 uncared for, and that they might now be eaten up by
 beasts of prey, than he threw asunder his hands and
 the knot was snapped at a pull. Kicking the Jamadar
 down to the ground in an instant he threw himself
 upon a sepoy. The other three sepoys then rushed on
 him and worsted and imprisoned him again. Weighed
 down with sorrow, he said to Satyananda : "If you
 had but helped me a bit we could have killed all the
 five miscreants.&rdquo;
