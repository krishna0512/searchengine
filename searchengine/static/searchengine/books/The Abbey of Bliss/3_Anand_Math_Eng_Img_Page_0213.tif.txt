 Santi instantly caught him by the neck and threw him
 to the ground. Then seating herself on the horse

 riding, or else she could not have lived with Jivananda.

 cealed and informed him of the state of affairs. Jiva-
 nanda said : "Then I shall instantly go to warn
Mahendra ; you better go and inform Satyananda. Go
 on horseback, so that the faster may be informed of
 it early.&rsquo;&rsquo; And the two started off in opposite direc-
 tions. Needless to say, Santi was now transformed into
 Nabinananda.
