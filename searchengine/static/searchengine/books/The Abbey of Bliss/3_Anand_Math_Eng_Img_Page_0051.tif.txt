Chapter IX
 Mahendra had got down from the cart, snatched
 his arms from a sepoy and was ready to fight. But he
 shortly knew that these people were robbers and had
 attacked the sepoys to plunder the treasure. So thinking,
 he drew off and stood apart from the field of fight. For,
 he thought, he would share the glamour of their mis-
 deeds if he aided these miscreants. He then threw
 down the sword and began slowly to walk away, when
 Bhavananda came and stood by him.
Mahendra asked, " Sir, who are you ? "
 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of your knowing it,&rdquo; retorted
Bhavananda.
 &ldquo; I have some use ;&mdash;I have been placed under a very
 deep obligation to you today."
" I did not see you felt like it. Sword in hand, you
 stood apart. You are a Zemindar&rsquo;s son, deft enough
 in devouring milk and butter, but no good for any
 strenuous work.
 He had scarcely finished when Mahendra retorted
 with scorn : &ldquo; But it was a wicked deed&mdash;it was robbery.&rdquo;
" Be it so," returned Bhavananda, &lsquo;' We have done
 you some good and wish to do some more. You might
 as well try to require.&rdquo;
M. You have done me some good, no doubt ; but
 what more good can you do ? And really it&rsquo;s better to go
 without any obligation than to be obliged to a robber.
