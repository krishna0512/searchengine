Appendix I
 SANNYASI REBELLION
 You will hear of disturbances committed by the
 Sannyasis, or wandering Fakeers, who annually infest
 the province, about this time of the year in pilgrimages
 to Jaggarnaut going in bodies of 1000 and sometimes
even 10,000 men. An officer of reputation (Captain
 Thomas) lost his life in an unequal attack upon a party
 of these banditti about 3000 of them, near Rungpore
 with a small party of Pergona Sepoys, which has made
 them more talked of then they deserve. The revenue,
 however, has felt the effects of their ravages in the
 northern districts. The new establishment of Sepoys
 which is now forming on the plan enjoined by the Court
 of Directors and the distribution of them ordered for the
 internal protection of the provinces, will, I hope, effec-
 tually secure them hereafter from these incursions,&mdash;

 Our own province has worn something of a warlike
 appearance, this year, having been infested by a band of
 Sannyasis, who have defeated two small parties of Pur-
 gunnah Sepoys (a rascally corps) and cut of the two
 officers who commanded them. One was Captain
 Thomas whom you know. Four battalions of the brigade
 Sepoys are now in pursuit of them, but they will not
 stand any engagement and have neither camp equipage,
 nor even clothes, to retard their flight. Yet I hope we
 shall yet make an example of some of them as they are
 shut in by rivers which they cannot pass when closely
 pursued.
