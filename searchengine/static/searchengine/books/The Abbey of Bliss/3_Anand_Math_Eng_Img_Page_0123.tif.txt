CHAPTER V
 The tete g tete with Mahendra finished, Satyananda
 entered with Mahendra the temple in the abbey where
 that beautiful and noble image of Vishnu was placed.
 There was an unusual display of beauty there at the
 hour. It was lit up with various lamps of gold and
 silver set with jewels, and heaps of flowers filled t he
 temple with beauty and fragrance.
 Within the temple sat another person who was slowly
 chanting the name of Hari. On Satyananda entering
 the room he stood up and made his obeisance. The
 monk then asked him, &lsquo;&rsquo; Do you want to be initiated ?&rsquo;
 &lsquo;'Please have the kindness,&rdquo; replied the man. Satya-
 uanda then addressed them both and said, &lsquo;&rsquo; Have you
 bathed and fasted and kept yourselves pure as enjoined ?&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &lsquo;Yes,&rdquo; they replied.
 &lsquo;"Take the vow in the presence of the Deity that you
 will scrupulously follow the rules of the &ldquo;children&rsquo;s creed.&rdquo;
"We will.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &ldquo;That you will renounce your home till the mother
 is saved.&rsquo;&rdquo;
" We will.&rsquo;&rsquo;
" Your brothers and sisters ?'
" Yes.&rdquo;
" Wife and children ?
" Yes.&rdquo;
" Kinsmen and servants ?&rdquo;
