CHAPTER  VIII           145
 wife, but in the life beyond Duty is everybody&rsquo;s God.
 To me my husband is very great, but greater is my duty,
 and greater still to me is my husband&rsquo;s Duty. I may
 forsake my duty if I will, but stand in the way of my
 husband&rsquo;s piety ?&mdash;No, Maharaj), that shall never be. My
 husband may die at your command&mdash;I will not stop
 him.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 With a long-drawn sigh the Brahmacharin replied:
 &lsquo;! Mother, sacrifice there must be in this great work of
 ours. Every one of us will have to be sacrificed. I
 shall die ; Jivananda, Bhavananda and every body else
 will die ; you too, mother, may die. But think of this,
 that it is best to die after doing some work. Why should
 we die without doing any great work ? I have never
 yet called anybody mother save my country. No one
 but this well-watered land of ours, rich in dainty fruits, is
 a mother to us. And now I call you my mother. As a
 mother, you must do your work. Take care. by all
 means, that the great object is gained. Save Jivananda&rsquo;s
 life and save yours.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 So saying Satyananda went out singing the glory
 of the Lord.
