154 THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 &ldquo;Do ore thing ; you keep a few of them with you.
 From the courage and tact which you have shown in
 the fight, I am sure, nothing would be impossible for you.
 You may keep the enemy engaged with this small force,
 and, under the cover of your force, I may take the rest
 across the river. Those who stay with you are sure to
 die. Those who come with me may be saved.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &lsquo;'Very well, I shall do so.&rdquo; So saying Bhavananda
 again charged the English artillery with two thousand
 soldiers with great energy, lustily shouting, &ldquo;Hail,
Mother.&rdquo; A fierce fight raged there, but the small army
 of Children could not stand long before the artillery.
 The gunners mowed them down like ripe crop.
 In the meantime Jivananda, with the rest of the
children turned slightly to the left and rounding the
 wood marched on to the bridge. Lieutenant Watson,
 an assistant of Thomas, saw from a distance that a body
 of children were slowly retiring. He therefore quickly
 followed them with a company of Foujdari sepoys and
 a company of Pergunnah sepoys.
 Captain Thomas saw this. Seeing that the main
 body of children were flying away, he said to an officer
 named Captain Hay : &ldquo; With two or three hundred
 sepoys I shall slay these rebels here, yon just follow
 them there with the guns and the rest of the force.
 Lieutenant Watson goes by the right, you attack them
 from the left ; but the access to the bridge must be
 blocked first ; when that is done we can surround them
 on three sides and kill them like birds in a net.
