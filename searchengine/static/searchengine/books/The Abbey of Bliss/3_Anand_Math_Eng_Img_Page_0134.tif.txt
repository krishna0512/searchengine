 at that time contemplating a face, with his eyes fixed
 above. We cannot say whose face it was, but it was a
 very lovely face with black and fragrant curls dropping
 loosely on long eyelashes that went close up to the
 ears. The little brow between them was immersed in
 the darksome shade of death, as though death and its
 conqueror were fighting on it. The eyes were shut, the
 eye-lashes steady, the lips blue, cheeks pale, the nose
 cold, and the wind playing with her clothes. Then
 somehow the grace of life slowly spread itself on
 the dead body just as the moon hid by autumn clouds lits
up the clouds and slowly unfolds her charm ; or as the
 morning sun slowly gilds the waving clouds one after
 another till it itself bursts out in its glory lights the
 world and cheers up land and water. Oh, what beauty,
 thought Bhavananda. He was engaged in this thought
 and did not speak. His heart was stung by Kalyani&rsquo;s
 charms, so he did not look on Santi&rsquo;s charms. Santi then
 went on to another room and asked " Whose room in
 this ?
"Jivananda Thakur&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
"Who is that ? Why, there is no one here.&rdquo;
"He must have gone somewhere and will be coming
 back presently.&rsquo;&rdquo;
"This is the best room.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"But you can&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Why not ?&rdquo;
"Jivananda Thakur stays here."
"Well, he may look out another room for himself."
