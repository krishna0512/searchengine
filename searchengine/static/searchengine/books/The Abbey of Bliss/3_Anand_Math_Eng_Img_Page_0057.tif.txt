CHAPTER X                                    35
 look at Magadha, Mithila, Kasi, Kanchi, Delhi, Kashmir,
 &mdash;where do you find such misery as here. Where else do
 the people eat grass for want of better food ? Where do
 they eat thorns and white-ants&rsquo; earth and wild creepers ?
Where do men think of eating dogs and jackals and
 even carcasses ? Where else can you find men getting so
 anxious about the money in their coffers, the salgram in
 their temples, the females in the Zenana, and the
 child in the mother&rsquo;s womb ? Yes, here they even rip
 open the womb ! In every country the bond that binds
 a sovereign to his subjects is the protection that he
 gives ; but our Mussalman King&mdash;how does he protect
 us ? Our religion is gone ; so is our caste, our honour and
 the sacredness of our family even ! Our lives even are
 now to be sacrificed. Unless we drive these tipsy long-
 beards away, a Hindu can no longer hope to save his
 religion.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &lsquo;'Well, but how can you drive them away ?&rsquo;&rdquo;
'' We will beat them.&rsquo;&rdquo;
"Alone, will you ? With a slap, I presume.&rdquo;
 The outlaw sang 
 &lsquo;&lsquo;Resounding with triumphal shouts
 From seventy million voices bold,
 With devotion served by twice
 As many hands that ably hold
 The sharp and shining rapier bold,
 &mdash;Thou a weakling we are told !
 M.''But  I see you are alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Bh. &lsquo;"Why, only now you saw two hundred of us.
 M, ''Are they all Children ?&rdquo;
