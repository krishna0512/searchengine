 poor to march immediately to co-operate with Captain
 Stewart, but to act separately in order to have the bet-
 ter chance of falling in with them. At the same time I
 ordered another battalion to march from the Dinapoor
 Station through Tyroot and by the northern frontier of
 the Purneah province, following the track which the
 Sannyasies usually took, in order to intercept them in
 case they marched that way. This battalion after acting
 against the Sannyasies, if occasion offererd, was directed
 to pursue their march to Cooch Behar, where they are to
 join Captain Jones and assist in the reduction of the
 country.
 Several parties of the Sannyasies having entered into
 the Purneah province, burning and destroying many
 villages there, the Collector applied to Captain Brook
 who had just arrived at Panity near Rajmahal, with his
 newly raised battalion of light infantry. That officer

 res against the Sannaysies, and had very near fallen in
 with a party of them, just as they were crossing the Cosa
 river, to escapc out of thatd province. They arrive on
 the opposite bank before their rear had entirely crossed,
 but too late to do any execution among them. It is
 apparent now that the Sannaysies are glad to escape as

 am still in hopes, that some of the detachments now
 acting against them may fall in with some of their parties,
 and punish them exemplarily for their audacity.
 It is impossible but that on account of the various
depredations which the Sannaysies have committed
 that revenue must fall short in some of the company&rsquo;s
 districts as well from real as from pretended losses. The
Board of Revenue aware of this last consideration, have
 come to the resolution of admitting no pleas for a re-
 duction of revenue but such as are attended with cir-
 cumstances of conviction : and by this mears they hope
 to prevent, as much as is in their power, all impositions on
