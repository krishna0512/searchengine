                        Chapter   XIII
 After the battle was won the victors were jubilant
 over their success and made great demonstrations round
 Satyananda. But he was sad tor Bhavananda&rsquo;s death.
So long the Vaishnavas had rot much musical
 accompaniment of the fight, but now thousands of drums
 and sanais, trumpets and other instruments, appeared
 on the scene. The woods and wilds, the river and the
 hills, were all filled with the din of victory and its echo.
 After they had exulted thus for some time, Satyananda
 said : "Heaven has smiled on us and the Children's cause
 has come out victorious. But we have one work yet
 left to do. It will rot do to forget those who can no
 more join us in our triumph and who have given up
 their lives to give us this festive occasion. Come, let
 us go and cremate those who are lying dead on the
 field, Specially should we do our duty by the hero
 who won this battle and died for us and cremate
 Bhavananda with due honour.&rdquo;
 TThe Children then went in a body to cremate the
 dead, crying&lsquo; Hail, Mother.&rsquo; Several men carried loads
 of sandal wood, crying Haribol, and with them built a
 pyre for Bhavananda. Laying him on it they fired the
 pyre and sang &lsquo;Hare Murare&rsquo; around it. The Children
 were worshippers of Vishnu but did not belong to the
 sect of the Vaishnavas. They therefore burnt their
 dead and did not bury them.
