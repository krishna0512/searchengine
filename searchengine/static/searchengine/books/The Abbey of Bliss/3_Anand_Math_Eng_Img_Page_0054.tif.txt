32 THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 He asked, "Who is the mother ? " Bhavananda did
 not answer but sang on:
 With silver moonbeams smile her nights
 And trees that in their bloom abound
 Adorn her ; and her face doth beam
 With sweetest smiles ; sweet&rsquo;s her sound 
 Joy and bliss she doth bestow ;
 To such a mother down I bow.
 "It is the country and no mortal mother &ldquo;&mdash;cried
 Mahendra. "We own no other mother," retorted Bhava-
 nanda ; " they say, &rsquo;the mother and the land of birth
 are higher than heaven.&rsquo; We think the land of birth
 to be no other than our mother herself. We have no
 mother, no father, no brother, no wife, no child, no
 hearth or home, we have only got the mother
 Who with sweetest water o'erflows
 With dainty fruits is rich endowed.
 Mahendra now understood the song and asked
 Bhavananda to sing again.
 He sang :
 Hail thee mother ! To her I bow,
 Who with sweetest water o&rsquo;erflows
 With dainty fruits is rich and endowed
 And cooling whom the south wind blows ;
 Who's green with crops as on her grow ;
 To such a mother down I bow !
 With silver moon beams smile her nights
 And trees that in their bloom abonnd
 Adorn her ; and her face doth beam
 With sweetest smiles, sweet&rsquo;s her sound !
 Joy and bliss she doth bestow ;
 To such a mother down I bow.
 Resounding with trumphal shouts
 From seventy million voices bold
