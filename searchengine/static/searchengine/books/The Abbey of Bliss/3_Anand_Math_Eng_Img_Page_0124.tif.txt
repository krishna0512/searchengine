100 THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 &ldquo;Everything we will give up.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Riches and pleasures.&rdquo;
"We renounce them all.&rdquo;
"You will conquer your passions and never share a
 seat with a woman 8&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &ldquo;We will never share such a seat and will corquer
 our impulses.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &ldquo;Swear in the Divine Presence that you will never
 earn any money for yourself or your relations and that
 what you earn you will make over to the treasury of
 our Society.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"We do swear.&rdquo;
"That you will take up arms yourselves and fight
 for the True Religion.&rdquo;
"We will.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That you will never fly from the battle-field.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"Never.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"It you break your vow ?&rdquo;
"We will enter a burning pyre or end our lives
 by taking poison.&rdquo;
 There is another thing,&rdquo; said Satyananda, &rsquo;and that
 is caste. To what caste do you belong ? I know
 Mahendra is a Kayestha but what is the caste of the
 other ?&rsquo;&rsquo;
"The other man replied, " I am a Brahmin.&rdquo;
"Well,&rdquo; said Satyananda, " could you give up your
 caste ? All the children belong to one caste ; we do not
 make any distinction between Brahmins and Sudras
 in this great mission. What do you say to that ?"
