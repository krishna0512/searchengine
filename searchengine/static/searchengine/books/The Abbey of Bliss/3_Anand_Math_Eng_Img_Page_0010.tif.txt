 fesses to do, he forgets himself and almost exults in deeds
 which his better sense soon condemns. His mysterious
 physician tells us that an empire could not be founded by
 robbery, and no good could come out of sin. In the preface he
 says that evolutions are persecutions and revolutionists are
 suicides. But still, till one comes to the close of it, one does
 not feel that the author is not in complete sympathy with the
 lawlessness perpetrated by his Children.
 Another point in which he strongly resembles Scott
 is intense patriotism. There can be no gainsaying the fact
 that both were the very best citizens of their respective king-
 doms and that both were inspired with a patriotism of the
 highest type. Yet the sort of patriotism that strikes their
 fancy most is not the patriotism which they themselves breathe.
 Scott was a good Britisher but in his writings he is intensely
 Scotch. Bankim Chandra too was a good Indian but in his
 writings he is most prominently a Bengali. The sort of
 patriotism that appeals to his fancy is the local feeling of the
Rajputs for their country and of the Children for mother
 Bengal. Intellectually he may have been a citizen of India
 and member of tho Indian nation but in his inmost heart was
 the sentiment of an intensely exclusive Bengali Hindu.
 Another accessory of a romantic temperament is its fascina-

 than he found it, yet this was the rooted conviction of Bamkim
