150 THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 &lsquo;'There are ten thousand Children present today,
 and you are their general for the day. See what you can
 do with them.&rdquo; Jivananda got himself fully armed and
 jumped on his horse. Only once he cast a glance on
 Nabinananda Goswami, and by it signified something
 to him which none could understand. Nor could any
 body know what Nabinananda answered with a glance;
 only they knew between themselves that very likely
 that was their last meeting this side of the grave. Then
 Nabinananda raised his right hand and said : &ldquo;Brothers,
 sing now the glory of the Lord,&rdquo;
 Then the ten thonsand Children, with thousands of
 arms uplifted, sang with one voice, resounding the
 woods and the sky and drowning the roar of can-
 nons:-
 &lsquo;&ldquo;To lay the Mleccha low
 With sword relentless" &mdash;
 At this time the shower of the English balls began
 to fall on the woods and among the Children&rsquo;s force.
 Some fell singing, with their head or hand or heart
 pierced, but no one stopped singing.
 When the song was finished every one was still.
 The dense forest, the sand bed of the river, and that in-
 finite loneliness,&mdash;all was plunged into deep silence. Only
 the dreadful roar of cannons, the murmur of the distant
 soldiers&rsquo; voices, the rustle of their arms and their heavy
 tread occasionally disturbed the silence.
 Then Satyananda shouted forth :  Hari, the Lord
 of Universe, will help you&mdash;how far are the guns ?
