 It is likely that in the struggle for existence the Bankim-
 ese style received an additional reinforcement from the mass
 of very superior literature that was written, mostly by himself
 and by others under his editorial guidance in the pages of
 his monthly, Bangadarsana. That literature was one of which
 any single generation might well be proud&mdash;if not for its
 volume at any rate for its quality. For the literary works
 of Bankim Chandra Chatterji still tower high above the ordirary
 run of books and proudly claim comparison, not with the
 rest of Bengali prose literature, for such a comparison is very
 obviously to its advantage, but with the literature of the world.
 In the world of letters Bankim Chandra Chatterji may
fairly claim an honoured place by the side of the greatest
 novelists of the world. His genius for fiction was superb and
 his execution of his work pre-eminently in his domestic
sketches presents some of the master pieces of the art. It
 would be too much to say however that the high level of ex-
 cellence is preserved in all his works. On the contrary, it is a
 comparatively few of his works that can be said to belong to
 the highest rank and there is perhaps only one, the krishna-
kanta's will , which can be regarded as perfectly faultless.
 The whole plot there has been deliberately conceived, the most
 artistic touches aptly bestowed and all embellishnments
 provided, without the slightest redundance or repetition,&mdash;it is
 in fact a perfect gem among novels and one that is fit to take
 its place beside the best of the world&rsquo;s fiction.
 For his novels Bankim Chandra has often been compared
 with Sir Walter scott and there is no doubt that the affinity
between them was more than superficial. In style, though
Bankim Chandra did not emulate the heavy tread of Sir
Walter&rsquo;s yet the style of both share the same frank openness
