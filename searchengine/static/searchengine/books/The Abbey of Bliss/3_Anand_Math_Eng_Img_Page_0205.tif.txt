 amused at Mahendra&rsquo;s discomfiture. smiled and threw
 a wistful look at Kalvani. The darkness was at once
 dispelled from Mahendra&rsquo;s eyes and he recognised that
 it was a woman&rsquo;s glance. Boldly he pulled by the
 beards of Nabinananda ; the false beards and moustache
 came off. Taking advantage of the moment, Kalyani
 too untied the knot that fixed the tiger-skin which
 slipped off from Santi&rsquo;s breast. Found out, Santi stood
 abashed with her eyes fixed on the ground.
 Mahendra then asked Santi, '' Who are you ?
'' I am Nabinananda Goswami.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &lsquo;'That&rsquo;s a sham, you are a woman !&rdquo;
'' So it turns out now.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 'Then I shall ask you one thing ; why do you, being
 a woman, live constantly with Jivananda Thakur.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;' It is better that I should not tell you that.&rsquo;
 &lsquo;' Does Jivananda know that you are a woman ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;' He does.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 The pure-souled Mahendra was very sorry to hear
 this. Seeing him in such a plight, Kalyani could contain
 herself no longer and said, &lsquo;&ldquo;She is Jivananda Goswami&rsquo;s
 married wife, Santi Devi.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 For a moment Mahendra&rsquo;s face brightened up with
 joy. At the next, it was covered with gloom. Kalyani
 understood what was passing in his mind and said, &ldquo; But
 she was sworn to a virgin life.&rdquo;
