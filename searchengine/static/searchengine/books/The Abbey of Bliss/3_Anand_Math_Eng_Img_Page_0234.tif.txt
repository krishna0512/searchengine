 the government, and to render the loss to the Company
 as inconsiderable as possible. Effectual means will be
 used by stationing some small detachments at proper
 posts on our frontier to prevent any future incursions
 from the Sannyasies Fakeers, or any other roving ban-
 ditti, a measure which only the extraordinary audacity
 of their last incursion have manifested to be necessary.
 &lsquo;This will be effected without employing many troops,
 and I hope that in no future time the sannyasies shall
 again suffer from this cause&mdash;Hastings to Sir George
colebrooke-dated 3Ist March I773.
 &lsquo;The Sannyasies threatened us with the same distur-
 bancea from the beginning of this year as we experienccd
 from then the last. But by being easily provided to
 oppose them, and one or two servere checks which they
 received in their first attempt, we have kept the country
 clear of them. A party of horse, which we employed
in pursuit of them, has chiefly contributed to intimidate
 these ravagers, who seemed to pay little regard to our
 Sepoys, having so much the advantage of them in speed,
 on which they entirely rely for their safety. It is my inten-
 tion to proceed more effectually against them by expelling
 them from their fixed residence, which they have estab-
 lished in the north eastern quarter of the province, and by
 making severe examples ot the Zemindars, who have
 afforded them protection or assistance&mdash;&mdash;Hastings a
