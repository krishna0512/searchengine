CHAPTER XI      43
 At the door you will find your wife and daughter.
 Kalyani has not yet taken any food. You will find
 food where they are sitting. Give her some and then
 take what you like yourself ; now you will not meet
 any of us. If your mind, however, remains unchanged,
 I shall come to you in proper time.&rdquo;
 Then suddenly the monk vanished by some
 strange passage. Coming out by the way shown
 to him, Mahendra saw Kalyani seated with her daugh-
 ter within the pavilion on the yard.
 Satyananda on the other hand got down to a seclu-
 ded underground chamber by another tunnel. There
 Jivananda ahd Bhavananda were counting money and
 arranging the coins in rows, There lay in that room
 heaps of gold, silver and copper and shining diamonds,
 pearls and coral. Bhavananda and Jivananda were
 putting the booty of last night in order.
 On entering the room, Satyananda said, "Jivananda,
 Mahendra will come to us. It will be very useful to us if
 he does, for then the hoarded wealth of generations of his
 ancestors will be put to the service of the Mother. But do
 not take him in till he is entirely and sincerely devoted
 to the Mother. When your work is done, do follow him
 at different times ; and when you see him fit, bring him
 to the temple of Sri Vishnu. And, by all means, save
 their lives, no matter when or how. for like the chas-
 tising of the wicked, the protection of the good too is
 a part of the The Children&rsquo;s mission.
