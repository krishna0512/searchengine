 &lsquo;'Boom-oom-oom-oom,&rdquo; roared the English guns.
 The vast forest shook with tho sound and echoed back
"boom-oom-oom-oom.&rdquo; Meandering through the banks
 of the river was echoed from the distant horizon
 the sound "boom-oom-oom-oom.&rsquo;&rsquo; It entered the
 other forest beyond the stream and sounded there
"boom-oom-oom-oom&rdquo; Satyananda ordered, &ldquo;come
 one to see whose guns they are,&rdquo; Some Children instant-
 ly jumped on horses and went about to see ; but no
 sooner had they come to some distance out of the woods
 than cannon balls were showered on them like the
 rain drops of Sravan and they all fell with their horses.
 Satyananda saw all this from a distance. &ldquo;Mount a lofty
 tree,&rdquo; he said, " and see what it is,&rdquo; Before he said this,
 Jivananda had done so and was watching in the light
 of dawn. From a high branch he shouted downwards,
"It is the English gun.&rdquo;
"Intantry or Cavalry,&rdquo; asked Satyananda.
"Both.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'How many are they ?&rdquo;
"Can&rsquo;t guess, they are still coming out of the woods.&rdquo;
"Only sepoys ? or are there Europeans too ?&rdquo;
"There are Europeans.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Satyananda then asked Jivananda to come down
from the tree, which he did.
