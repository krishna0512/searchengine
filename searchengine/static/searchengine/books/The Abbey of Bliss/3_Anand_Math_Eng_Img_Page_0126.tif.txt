Chapter VI
 After the ceremony of initiation was over, Sartya-
 nanda led Mahendra to a secluded place. When they
 had taken their seats Satyananda said : &ldquo; My child, I
 regard it as a sign of God&rsquo;s favour to our cause that you
 have taken this vow. A very great service to the
 Mother will be done by you. Listen to my orders
 with care now, I do not want you to rove in the woods,
 fighting, like Jivananda and Bhavananda. You will have
 now to return to Padachinha and to pursue an ascetic&rsquo;s
 avocations at home.&rsquo;'
 Mahendra was sorry and surprised to hear this, but
 said nothing. &lsquo;"At present,&rdquo; the monk went on, &ldquo;we
 have no place to shelter us, none where we might stock
 our provisions and shut ourselves up securely for a few
 days, if pressed by a powerful force. We have no forti-
 fications. You have got big buildings and your village
 is in your own possession. I desire to build a fortress
 there, If we could throw a ditch and ramparts round
 the village, establish watches at intervals, and place
 guns on the ramparts, we could make a gocd fort
 altogether. You just go to your home. By and by, a
 thousand Children will reach your place. You will then
 have to begin to build the fortifications with them. You
 will build a strong iron chamber in the fort, which will
 be the treasury of the Children. I shall send to your
 place chests filled with gold which you will require
