CHAPTER X                        155
 Remember you have to deal with swift-footed native
 troops, with whom retreating is the strongest point.
 You cannot easily reach them by following ; so you
 had better despatch your cavalry by a round-about way
 to block the bridge. That will finish the business.&rdquo;
 Captain Hay went out with Thomas&rsquo; orders.
 ''Lanka fell for the pride of its ruler,&rsquo;&rsquo; they say.
 Captain Thomas in his supreme scorn for the Children
 kept only two hundred of the in infantry with him to
 fight Bhavananda and sent away the rest with Hay.
 The clever Bhavananda saw that the English guns
 and the major part of their forces were gone and
 found that what remained of it might be easily
 destroyed. He then called out such of his troops as
 yet survived and said: "we have got to go and help
 Jivananda after slaying these few soldiers. Comrades,
 cry again, Victory to Hari, the Lord of Universe.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 The handful of the Children then cried "Victory to
 Hari, Lord of Universe &rdquo; and fell on Captain Thomas
 like tigers. The handful of sepoys and Telingis could
 not stand the fury of that attack and fell. Bhavananda
 himself then jumped on Captain Thomas and caught
 him by his hair. He had been fighting to the last.
 Bhavananda said, "Captain Saheb, wve shall not kill
 you ; the English are not our enemies. But why did
 you come in as friends of the Mussulmans ? Come, I
 shall save your life, and for the present you  are my
 prisoner. We wish all joy to Englishmen, we are your
 friends.&rsquo;&rdquo;
