revels in sound. In that vast lonely forest, in that
 pitch-dark midnight, and from that unimaginable still-
 ness same forth the words, &ldquo;Will my desire not be
fulfilled.&rsquo;&rsquo;
When the sound died away, the woods sank back into
 silence. Who would think then, that a man&rsquo;s voice had
 just been heard in the woods ? Soon after, the words
 were heard again ; again the stillness was disturbed,
 and a human voice rang forth : "Will my desire not
 be fulilled ?
 Thrice was the ocean of gloom thus stirred before
 the answer came, " What can you pawn for it ?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Even my very life.&rdquo;
"Life is a trifle,&rdquo; was the answer, "every one can
 give it up.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;What more have I got ? What more could I give ?&rsquo;
 The answer came : "DEVOTION."
