 will come under our flag if they hear that a Hindu
 kingdom has been established.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Then Jivananda and others bowed to him and said:
 &ldquo;Maharaj, if you so command, we shall establish your
 throne in these woods.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Satyananda flew into a rage for the first time in his
 life. &ldquo; For shame,&rdquo; he said, "do you take me for an
 empty vessel like that ? We are none of us a king ; we
 are all ascetics, The Lord of Balikuntha himself is the
 king of this country, When the city is conquered, you
 may give the crown to whomsoever you like, but know
 this for sure that no state but that of a monk shall be
 mine. You may now go to do your several duties.&rdquo;
 Then the four bowed to Satyananda and rose to
 go, when Satyananda made a sign to Mahendra, to stay,
 unnoticed by others. The other three went away
 and Mahendra waited. Satyananda then said to him,
 &ldquo;You all did take your vow in the temple of Vishnu.
 Bhavananda and Jivananda failed to keep it. Bhava-
 nanda has made the expiation promised. I am always
 in fear that some day Jivananda too will give up his
 life by way of expiation. I have one hope howvever ;
 for some secret reason he will not he able to die now.
 You alone have kept your faith. The object of the
Children  has been gained. Your vow was that you
 should not see the face of your wife and child till our
 work was done. Now it is done. You may now be a
 householder again.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 Torrents of tears rained down Mahendra&rsquo;s cheeks.
