drank the murky water of ponds and then walked again,
 suffering terribly. Mahendra held the child in his arms
 and fanned it now and then. Once they sat down to
 rest under a tree decked with dense green foliage and
 fragrant flowers, and fondly encircled by creepers,
Mahendra was surprised at the patience with which
 Kalyani roughed all this out. He soaked his cloth in
 the pond which was there, and with its water drenched
 the face, hands and feet of Kalyani and himself.
Kalyani was slightly refreshed, but they were both
 oppressed by hunger. This they could stand, but the
 hunger and thirst of the little child they could not
 bear. Therefore they walked on and on,&mdash;they swam
 so to say across the torrent of fire, till at dusk they
 reached an inn. Mahendra fondly hoped that there he
 would be able to refresh his wife and child with cool
 water and give them some food to keep them from star-
 vation. But alas, he found no one in the inn. Big huts
 lay there, the men had all led. Mahendra looked about.
 He then made his wife and child lie down in one of
 the rooms, and coming out shouted to the top of his
 voice, No one answered. Then he said to Kalyani, &ldquo;Do
 just gather up courage to stay alone for a while ; it there
 is a cow in the land, Srikrishna help me, I&rsquo;ll get some
 milk.&rdquo; So saying he walked out with an earthen pitcher
 in hand,&mdash;there were many such lying about in that
 place.
