 anew? I have already had to go through that ceremony
 once before.&rsquo;&rdquo;
" You must give up your old creed and take a creed
 from me anew.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'How am I to give up my Mantram ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'I shall show you the way.&rsquo;
"Why should t have to take-a new one ?&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Because the Children are all Vaishnavas.&rdquo;
"I do not know how it is so. How could the Children
 be Vaishnavas when the avoidance of all blood -shed is
 considered as the highest virtue with them ?&rdquo;
"Thats the Vaishnava creed of Chaitanya. It is the
 creed of that spurious Vaishnavism which grew up in
 imitation of atheistic Buddhism. The ideal of true
 Vaishnavism is the chastisement of the wrong-doers and
 the salvation of mother earth ; for our pa tron Deity is
 the Preserver of the Universe. Ten times was he born
 in flesh to save the world. It was he who fought and
 killed demons like Keshi, Hiranyakasipu, Madhu,
Kaitabha, Mur and Narak, Rakshasas like Ravana, and
 tyrants like Kansa and Sisupala. He is the Victor and
 the Bestower of Victory. He is the saviour of the world
 and the patron Deity of &lsquo;&ldquo;The Children.&rdquo; Chaitanya&rsquo;s
 Vaishnavism is not true Vaishnavism, but only half
 the true faith. Its God is only Love ; but the true God
 is not Love alone but also Infinite Power. Chaitanya&rsquo;s
 Vishnu is all Love, our Vishnu is all Power, We are
 all of us Vaishnavas but the creed of either is only half
 the whole creed. Do you grasp it ?&rdquo;
