                          CHAPTER IX                          151
Some one answered from above : "Very near the
 wood, only beyond a small field.&rdquo;
 "Who are yon,&rdquo; asked Satyananda.
 &lsquo;'I am Nabinananda,&rdquo; came the answer from above.
 Then Satyananda said, "You are ten thousand and
 you must win. Go and seize the guns.&rdquo;
 Then Jivananda who rode before said, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
 The ten thousand Children, infantry and cavalry,
 followed Jivananda. The foot-soldier carried a musket
 on his shoulder, a sword by his side and a spear in his
 hand. So soon as they came out, they were shattered by
 a profuse shower of bullets. Numerous Children fell to
 the ground without a fight. Some one said to Jivananda :
"What&rsquo;s the use of killing people without the chance of
 a fight ?&rdquo;
 Jivananda turned round and saw it was Bhavananda.
 He asked, " What do you want me to do now ?&rdquo;
"Let us defend ourselves from the woods under the
 shelter of the trees. Without a gun, our army will not
 stand for one moment the shower of bullets in open
 space. But we can keep up the fight pretty long from
behind the wood.&rdquo;
J. You are right, no doubt, but our master has
 ordered that the cannon must be seized.
B. No one can do that. But if it must be done,
 you had better stay ; I will go.
J. That cannot be, Bhavananda, to-day I am to die.
B. It is I that must die to-day.
J. I must make my expiation.
