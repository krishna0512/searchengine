chapter V
 Bhavananda walked towards the Abbey in a contems-
 plative mood. Night overtook him on the way. He was
 alone on the way, alone did he enter the forest, but he
 now found that some one else walked before him.
 &ldquo;Who is that ?&rsquo;&rsquo; enquired Bhavananda.
 The man who walked before him answered :"I
 could answer if you knew how to ask the question.&rdquo;
"Hail,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Bhavananda.
"Mother,&rsquo;&rsquo; came the reply.
"I am Bhavananda Goswami.&rdquo;
"I am Dhirananda.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Dhirananda, where had you been ?&rsquo;
"In quest of yourself.&rdquo;
"Why.&rdquo;
"To have a word with you."
"About what ?"
"It should be spoken in private.&rdquo;
&ldquo;This is a very lonely place, you may say here what
 you have got to say."
"You went to town ?"
"Yes.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"To Gouri Devi&rsquo;s place ?&rdquo;
"Did you go there too ?&rdquo;
"A very beautiful damsel lives there ?"
 Bhavananda was a little startled, a little afraid.
"What do you mean by all this ? &rdquo; he asked.
