 ed by a company of huntsmen. To tell the truth,
 captain Thomas was fearless, and for boldness and
 strength he was an example even to Englishmen. The
 wood teemed with tigers, buffaloes, bears and other wild
 beasts, After some distance was passed the huntsmen
 refused to go further and said there was no way further
 on. Donniworth had once been encountered by such
 a tiger in the woods that he too was not inclined to go
 further. They were for turning back, but the Captain
 said : "You may return, but I won&rsquo;t." So he entered the
 depths of the forest alone. In fact there was no way
 into it. The horse could not proceed further, but the
 Captain left it, walked alone into the woods with a gun
 in hand and looked about for a tiger. He did not find
 any tiger, but who was there sitting under a huge
 tree covered over with flowery creepers ? It was a
 young devotee who lit gp the woods with the charm of
 her person. It seemed as if the blooming flowers grew
more fragrant by the touch of that heavenly body. The
 Captain was surprised, but his surprise was followed by
 wrath. He knew the native dialect fairly well, and, in
 his queer accents, asked in vernacular "Who are you ?&rdquo;
 The devotee answered :" I am a devotee.&rdquo;
"You are a rebel,&rsquo; answered the captain, unable to
 express his sense in vernacular.
 &lsquo;&lsquo;What is that ? &rdquo; enquired the ascetic.
 &ldquo;I will shoot you down,&rdquo; said the captain in his
 broken accents.
"Do so,&rdquo; said the Sannsyasi.
