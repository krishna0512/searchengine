Chapter X
 In that smiling moonlit night, the two silently
 walked across the plain. Mahendra was silent, sad,
 careless and a little curious,
 Bhavananda suddenly changed his looks. He was
 no more the steady and mild anchorite, nor wore any
 more the warlike hero&rsquo;s face&mdash;the face of the slayer of a
 captain of forces, Not even was there in his mien the
 proud disdain with which he had scolded Mahendra even
 now. It seemed as if his heart was filled with joy at the
 beauteous sight of the earth, lulled in peace and beaming
 under the silvery moon, and of the glory in her wilds and
 woods and hills and streams, and grew cheery like the
 ocean smiling with the rise of the moon, Bhavananda
 grew chatty, cheerful, cordial and very eager to talk. He
 made many an attempt to open a conversation with
 his companion but Mahendra would not speak, Having
 no option left, he then began to sing to himselft:
 Hail thee mother ! To her I bow,
 Who with sweetest water o'erflows
 With dainty fruits is rich endowed
 And cooling whom the south wind blows,
 Who&rsquo;s green with crops as on her grow s
 &lsquo;To such a mother down I bow.
 Mahendra was a little puzzled to hear the song ; he
 could not grasp anything, Who could be the mother, he
 thought.
 "Who with sweetest water o'erflows,
 With dainty fruits is rich endowed
 And cooling whom the south wind blows ?
 Who's green with crops as on her grow.
