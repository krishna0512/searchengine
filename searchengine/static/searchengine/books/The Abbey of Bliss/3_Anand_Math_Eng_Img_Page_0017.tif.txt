 consideration which has prompted me to translate the work
 in spite of its defects.
 The work of translation has been by no means a plain
 sailing. Yet with all its difficulties the work has been one of
 love and a joy to me. I do not therefore feel entitled to claim
 any indulgence from the reader or quarter from the critic on
 that score. The work, however, has been rushed through the
 press for the importunity of my publisher and I shall not be
 the least surprised if faults are found to have been permitted to
 remain.
 In conclusion, I have to convey my best thanks to my
 esteemed friend Mr. Prithwis Chandra Ray, the Editor of the
 Indian World for his constant encouragement and support, in
 placing every facility at my disposal, in looking over the proofs,
 and in making several very important suggestion. To the
 management of the Cherry Press too I am thankful for the
 expedition and promptness with which the work has been done.
