68                         THE ABBEY OF BLISS
"Do yon know,&rdquo; said Jivananda in feigned anger,
&ldquo;how many men I&rsquo;ve killed ?&rdquo;
 Nimi grew very much offended. A great thing that
 to brag of, to be sure &rdquo; said she. " You&rsquo;ll desert your
 wife and kill people and you think I will fear you.
 Never think of that, tor, mind you, we are children of
 the same parents. If killing is a great thing you may as
 well kill me and brag of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Jivananda smiled and said : "Go and fetch her,&mdash;the
 Wretch. But mind, it you speak to me Hike this again, t
 may spare you but I&rsquo;ll cut the hairs off the head of the
 rogue of your husband and with whey on his shaven
 knoll make him ride a donkey with tail foremost.&rdquo;*
 Nimi said in an undertone, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be half sorry
 for it,&rdquo; and went away smiling. She then entered a
 cottage close by, in which a woman with shaggy hairs
 was spinning on a wheel with a tattered rag on. Nimi
 went and said &ldquo;Bow, quick, quick.&rdquo;
 'Well, what&rsquo;s it, why are you in such a hurry ? Thy
 husband has beaten thee and I am to oil thy sores ; is
 it ?,&rdquo; said the Bow smiling.
"Very much near the mark,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Nimi, " have you
 got oil in the room ?&rsquo;
 &ldquo;I have translated the joke literally as to rerder it in any other way
 would have been hopeless. The brother-in-law is a licensed joker and a
 butt of jokes himself in Bengali Society. Shaving of one&rsquo;s heal, bathing
 in whey, and making one ride a donkey specially with the tail foremost is
 regarded as a great indignity, and people were usually put to such
 punishments by tyrants of yore. The threat of this indignity is a common
 joke in Bengal.
