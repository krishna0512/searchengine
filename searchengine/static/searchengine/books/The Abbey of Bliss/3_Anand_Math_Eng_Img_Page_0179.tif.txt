                                Chapter X
 The army of ten thousand Children advanced swiftly
 upon the artillery with their spears up, singing &lsquo;Hail,
 Mother.&rsquo; They were killed in numbers and rent as-
 sunder, terribly suffering from the incessant shower of
 cannon balls ; but still they did not turn back. Presently
 a body of sepoys charged them with their bayonets
 on their right flank under the orders of Captain Thomas.
 Attacked from both sides the Children then gave up all
 hopes. Hundreds of them were being killed at every
 moment. Jivananda then said, "Bhavananda, you are
 right. There is no need for the massacre of more
 Vaishnavas. Let us slowly retire.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'How can you retire now f Whoever turns back
 now will die.&rdquo;
 "We have been attacked on the front and in the
 right flank, there is nothing on the left. Come let us
 turn round and retire by the left."
 &lsquo;'Where could you retire ? Don&rsquo;t you know there is
 a river that side which has been swelled by the rains ?
 Do you mean to drown the army of Children in the
 river ?&rsquo;&rsquo;
"But there is a bridge on it, I think.&rdquo;
"If ten thousand soldiers were to cross by that
 bridge, they would make such a hopeless rush that, I
 am sure, with one gun the enemy could easily destroy
 our whole army.&rsquo;&rsquo;
