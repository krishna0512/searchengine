CHAPTER XII                 161
"I did not mean that,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Bhavananda, &lsquo;&rsquo; but you
 cannot pass your days happily in the company of your
 wife and children.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 &lsquo;'Oh, you are speaking of yesterday&rsquo;s affair. You
 have not understood it yet, I am afraid.&rdquo; (Dhirananda
 killed the wounded soldier),
 &lsquo;'No,&rdquo; said Bhavananda. Just then his right arm
 was cut down by a white soldier.
 &lsquo;'It was not for me to venture to tell you all those
 things. I was sent as a spy by Satyananda.&rsquo;
"What !", exclaimed Bhavananda, "the Master
 doubts my faith ?" Bhavananda was fighting with one
 hand. Dhirananda defended him and said : "He heard
 with his own ears the conversation that passed between
 you and Kalyani.&rsquo;&rsquo;
"How ?&rdquo;
"He was then at that place. Look sharp !&rdquo; (Bhava-
 nanda was struck by a white soldier but warded off the
 blow). "He was teaching Gita to Kalyani when you
 came. Take care.&rdquo; (Bhavananda&rsquo;s left hand too was
 now cut down).
B. Give him the news of my death and tell him I
 am no traitor.
 Dhirananda&rsquo;s eyes were filled with tears. fighting
 on, he said : " He knows it. Recall his blessing to you
 last night. He told me to-day, &lsquo;Keep near Bhavananda
 during the fight, he will die to-day. Tell him when he
 is dying that I have blessed him and am sure that he
 will reach Baikuntha after death&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo;
