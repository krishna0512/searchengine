64 THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 Then the girl Forthwith went to warm some milk and
 Jivananda found congenial occupation in turning the
 spinning-wheel awhile. The child, since it came to
 the young woman, never thought of crying. We don&rsquo;t
 know what it thought&mdash;perhaps it took the girl for its
 mother, finding her as lovely as a lotus in full bloom.
 But perhaps the flame had slightly seared her and she
 cried once. On hearing it Jivananda shouted out :&rdquo;O
 Nimi, you wicked wench ; what are you about ? Haven&rsquo;t
finished warming the milk yet ?&rdquo;
"Yes, brother,&rsquo; answered Nimi, &lsquo;'I have finished,&rsquo;&rsquo;
 and she poured the milk in a stone cup and brought It
 to Jivananda.
 Jivananda pretended to be mightily angry and said:
 &lsquo;! I have half a mind to throw this hot milk in your face.
You think I should be drinking the milk, Eh ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'Who&rsquo;ll take it then ?,&rdquo; asked Nimi.
 &lsquo;'Don&rsquo;t you see the girl ? Feed her with this, would
 you ?,&rdquo; said Jivananda.
 Nimi then squated down on the floor, laid the girl on
 her lap and began to feed her with a spoon. A few drops
 of tears however rolled down her cheek. She had had
 a son who was dead and the spoon with which she fed
 the girl now belonged to him. She instantly wiped her
 eyes. however and smiled as she asked, &ldquo;Do tell me,
 brother, whose daughter it is ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'What&rsquo;s that to thee, you naughty thing ?,"retorted
 Jivananda.
 "Give me the girl, would you ?&rdquo;
