184       THE ABBEY OF BLISS 
 I want the information tonight. A hundred rupees
 will he your reward.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Give a hundred or a thousand, what you will, but
 these legs can&rsquo;t cover twenty miles.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'Could you go on horseback ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'If I could ride a horse, do you think I should he
 coming to your camp to sing and beg ?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, yon may be carried on the lap.&rdquo;
 ! On the Lap ! Why, have t no modesty 9&ldquo;
 &lsquo;'What a fix I I&rsquo;ll pay you five hundred rupees.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;&ldquo;Who will go with me ? Yourself ?&rdquo;
 The Major then pointed to a young Ensign named
Lindlay who stood before him and asked, " Well
 Lindlay, would you go ?&rdquo;
 Lindlay&rsquo; looked at Santi&rsquo;s beauty and youth, and
 answered, &lsquo;" gladly.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 A great Arab horse was then brought there and
 Lindlay dressed himself. He then tried to help Santi
 on the horse but Santi said, &lsquo;' For shame ! not before so
 many men. Let&rsquo;s go a little way out of the camp.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 Lindlay mounted the horse and took it at a walking
 pace, Santi following. So they came out of the camp.
 Teaching the lonely plain out of the camp, Santi
 put her foot on Lindlay&rsquo;s and lightly jumped on the
 horse. Lindlay smiled and said, &ldquo;I see you are a pucca
 rider,&rsquo;&rdquo;
 &lsquo; Yes, such a one that I am ashamed to ride with
 you ! To think of riding a horse with feet in the
 stirrup ! For shame !&rdquo;
