108  THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 am an austere woman and will remain so before your
 Holiness. I have come to practice piety only and not
 that I may have the pleasure of seeing my husband.
 I didnot come because I was pining under the pang
 of separation. I have come because I feel that I ought

 I have fire on my brow. Is it I or your mother that
 has had her forehead burnt.&rsquo;&rsquo;?

 &ldquo;Porakapali  or a woman with a'burnt forehead  luck) is a term of
 abuse. Santi here mischievously translates Satyananda&rsquo;s reference to the
 fire on her brow&mdash;by which he meant the Fire of her eyes&mdash;into an insuma
 tion that she was as woman with n burnt brow. &lsquo;The abuse is also other-
 wise worded e, g. rar Paxale azt, &lsquo;let the ire be on thy forehead.&rsquo;
