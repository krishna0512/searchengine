 though the story ia beautiful enough and its execution on the
whole well worthy of a master&rsquo;s hand, yet it bears patent signs
 of haste and careless manipulation, and, in spite of the
 cobbling and tinkering that it had during its subsequent edi-

 of view of feeling rather than of conception. For the
 type of patriotism which our author has here depicted is
 certainly not the richest in conception nor well worthy of
 emulation. It is its intensity in feeling and its richness in self-
 sacrifice that ought to commend it to all right-thinking people.
 The reader must however be warned against taking the parable
