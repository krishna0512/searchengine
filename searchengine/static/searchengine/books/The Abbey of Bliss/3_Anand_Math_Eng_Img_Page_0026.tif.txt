 even at midday and in that darkness pensively sat two
 human beings like a couple of full-blown flowers at
 midnight.
The famine was before them.
 In 1174 there was a bad harvest. So food became a
 little dear in 1175. The people were in distress but the
State realised its dues to the last penny. Having paid
 dowvn the royal dues, the poor people satisfied them-
 selves with but one meal a day and struggled on.
 There was a good shower during the rains 1175
 and the people thought with joy that the gods had
 perhaps smiled on them. The shephard began his
 carol again and the peasant&rsquo;s wife began to tease her
 spouse for her silver armlet. Suddenly the gods
 turned angry in Aswin, for there was not a drop of rain
 in that month and the crops in the field dried up into
 hay. Those who reaped a harvest at all had their crop
 bought up by the State for the support of its army.
 The pcople therefore starved. At first they had one
 meal a day, then they went on half rations, and then
 starved the whole day. The small Chaitra harvest
 that they gathered was not enough for anybody. But
Mahommad Reza Khan, the officer in charge of the State
 revenue, thought that he would be a favourite of the
 authorities by a stroke at this time, and forthwith en-
 hanced the assessment by 10 per cent. There was a howl
 of grief all over Bengal.
First, people began to beg. But soon there
 was none to give alms ;&mdash;they then began to starve.
