Chapter XVI
 The Bow was aged twenty-five but she did not look
 a day older than Nimi. As she entered the house in her
 rags, it seemed to be lit up with her grace as if many
 budding flowers which had been lying hidden under
 leaves suddenly burst out in bloom&mdash;as it a bottle of
 rose water which lay tight corked had been suddenly
 broken up&mdash;as if some body had thrown the incense into
 a smouldering fire which burst into flame and fragrance.
 On entering the house she looked about for her husband.
 She could not ind him at once. Then she saw that,
 laying his head on the trunk of a small mango tree that
 stood in the yard, Jivananda stood weeping. She slowly
 walked up to him and held him by his hand.We do
 not say that her eyes did not grow wet&mdash;Heaven knows
 that the stream that rushed to her eyes could drown
 Jivananda if it were allowed to flow. But she restrained
 herself and with her husband&rsquo;s hand in hers, said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
 weep dear, I know you are weeping for me, but I am
 quite happy with my present life.&rsquo;&rsquo;
 Jivananda looked up, wiped his eyes, and asked his
 wife t "Dear, why are you in this tattered garb ? I did
 not certainly leave you in want.&rsquo;
 &lsquo;&lsquo;Your wealth,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Santi, &rsquo;I have kept for you. I
 do not know what to do with money. When you come
 back and take me back as your wife&mdash;&rdquo;
