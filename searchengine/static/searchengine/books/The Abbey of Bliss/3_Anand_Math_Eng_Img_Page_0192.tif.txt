 He said : &ldquo;Sire, with whom am I to build my home
 again ? My wife poisoned herself before I took the vow,
 and I do not know where my daughter is. Nor do I
 know where I am to look for her. You told me she
 lives yet, and that is all that I know of her."
 Satyananda then called Nabinananda and introduced
 this young ascetic to Mahendra with these words.
 &lsquo;&ldquo;This is Nabinananda Goswami&mdash;a very pure soul
 and a favourite disciple of mine. Nabinanda will give
 you all in formation about your daughter.&rsquo;&rsquo; So saying,
 Satyananda made a sign to her. Santi understood the
 sign, bowed to him, and was about to go when Mahendra
 asked, "Where may I see you ?&rdquo;
 &lsquo;'Come to my cottage please,&rdquo; she said, and herself
 showed him the way.
 Mahehdra made his obeisance to Satyanarda and
 departed wvith Santi to her cottage. The night was
 then far advanced, but Santi did not stop. She was
 going to the town.
When all of them had left and the monk was alone,
 he bowed his head and, lowering it to the ground, en-
 gaged himseltf in meditating the glory of the Lord.
 &lsquo;The night was well nigh up when some one came and
 touched him on his head and said &lsquo;"I have come.&rdquo;
 &lsquo;The monk rosc startled, and anxiously said, &ldquo;You
 have come ? Why ?&rsquo;
 &lsquo;Your time is up,&rdquo; was the answer.
" My lord,&rdquo; said Satyananda, &ldquo; forgive me to-day, I
 shall do your bidding on the next full-moon day of Magh.&rdquo;
