156                        THE ABBEY OF BLISS
 Captain Thomas then tried to raise a gun mounted
 with a bayonet to kill Bhavananda, but Bhavananda
 had caught him like a tiger and he could not move.
 Then at Bhavananda&rsquo;s command two or three Children
 bound him down. Bhavananda said, ' Take him on a
 horse and let us go to the aid of Jivananda.&rdquo;
 Then the few soldiers tied Captain Thomas to a
 horse and ran after Lieutenant Watson, crying :Hail,
 Mother.&rdquo;
The Children under Jivananda were demoralised and
 were about to fly. Jivananda and Dhirananda ex-
 pected them to keep them to the ranks. But they could
 not manage everybody. Some fled to take shelter in
 the mango grove. The rest of the soldiers Jivananda
 and Dhirananda took to the bridge. But there Hay and
 Watson attacked them from two sides and it seemed
 to be all over with them.
