 Chandra, and it was the one with which he set to work. The
 aspect of a novelist&rsquo;s function which struck him most was
 that of a teacher and never in his writings does he forget his
 avocation of a born teacher of his people.
 He was well fitted to fill the place. with nature&rsquo;s liberal
 endowment was joined in him a sound education in the
 literature of the past as well as in the ideas of the new civilisa-

 evident that the author does not care to be taken as a story
 teller at all. The story is only the setting. The whole interest
 is concentrated in the message that he seeks to impart and
