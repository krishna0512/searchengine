Snapshots
&lsquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the history teacher with heavy sarcasm
&lsquo;perhaps you will be so kind as to tell the class the Einstein
theory of education.&rdquo;
Albert flushed.
&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s not facts that matter, but ideas, "he said. "I don&rsquo;t
see the point in learning the dates of battles. or even which of
the armies killed more men. I&rsquo;d be more interested in learning
why those soldiers were trying to kill each other.&rdquo;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Mr Braun's eyes were cold and cruel. "We
don&rsquo;t want a lecture from you. Einstein. You will stay in for an
extra period today, although I don&rsquo;t imagine it will do you much
good. It won&rsquo;t do the school any good, either. You are a disgrace.
I don&rsquo;t know why you continue to come.&rdquo;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not my wish, sir.&rdquo; Albert pointed out
"Then you are an ungrateful boy and ought to be ashamed
of yourself. I suggest you ask your father to take you away.&rdquo;
Albert felt miserable when he left school that afternoon: not
that it had been a bad day- most days were bad now, anyway- 
but because he had to go back to the hateful place the next
morning. He only wished his father would take him away. but
there was no point in even asking. He knew what the answer
would be: he would have to stay until he had taken his diploma.
Going back to his lodgings did not cheer him up. His father
had so little money to spare that Albert had been found a room
in one of the poorest quarters of Munich. He did not mind the
bad food and lack of comfort. or even the dirt and squalor, but
he hated the atmosphere of slum violence. His landlady beat
her children regularly. and every Saturday her husband came
drunk and beat her&rsquo;!
&lsquo;But at least you have a room of your own, which is more
than I can say.&rdquo; said Yuri when he called round in the evening.
&lsquo;&lsquo;At least you live among civilised human beings. even if they
are all poor students.&rdquo; said Albert.
"They are not all civilised,&rdquo; Yuri replied. &lsquo;Did you not hear
that one of them was killed last week in a duel?&rdquo;
"And what happens to the one who killed him?&rdquo;
&lsquo;Nothing, of course. He is even proud of it. His only worry is
that the authorities have told him not to fight any more duels.
He&rsquo;s upset about this because he hasn&rsquo;t a single scar on his
face to wear for the rest of his life as a badge of honour."
&lsquo;Ugh!&rdquo; exclaimed Albert. "And these are the students.&rdquo;
&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll be a student one day.&rdquo; said Yuri.
