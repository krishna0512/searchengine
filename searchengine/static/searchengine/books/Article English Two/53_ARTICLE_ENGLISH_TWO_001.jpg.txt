Albert Einstein at School
Patrick Pringle
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) is regarded as the greatest physicist since
Newton. In the following extract from The Young Einstein,the well-known
biographer, Patrick Pringle, describes the circumstances which led to Albert
Einstein's expulsion from a German school
&lsquo;IN what year, Einstein.&rdquo; asked the history teacher, &lsquo;&rsquo;did the
Prussians defeat the French at Waterloo?&rdquo;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,
&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you know? You&rsquo;ve been told it often enough.&rdquo;
&lsquo;I must have forgotten.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Did you ever try to learn?&rdquo; asked Mr Braun.
&lsquo;No. sir.&rdquo; Albert replied with his usual unthinking honesty.
&lsquo;Why not?
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see any point in learning dates. One can always look
them up in a book.&rdquo;
Mr Braun was speechless for a few moments.
&lsquo;You amaze me, Einstein.&rdquo; he said at last. "Don&rsquo;t you realise
that one can always look most things up in books? That applies
to all the facts you learn at school.&rdquo;
&lsquo;Yes, sir.
&lsquo;Then I suppose you don&rsquo;t see any point in learning facts.&rdquo;
&lsquo;Frankly, sir, I don&rsquo;t, said Albert
&lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t believe in education at all?
&lsquo;Oh, yes. sir. I do. I don&rsquo;t think learning facts is education.&rsquo;
