CHAPTER S
NEUROSCIENTIST
In 2011, as part of an assignment we travelled halfway across world to Boston, USA. Boston 
along with the metropolitan area of Greater Boston, is a vibrant city with about 45 lakh people and
one of the oldest districts in the United States. What makes it unique is the fact that is home to some 
of the finest universities in the world  including Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. These institutions have produced some of the finest scientific minds in the world; in
fact more than 150 Nobel league have been associated with Harvard alone. The university is also 
part of the prestigious Ivy League group educational Institutions which comprise eight prominent 
universities in the United states.
On a pleasant day in September upon finishing our assignment earlier than expected. we decided to
take a stroll along Oxford Street a beautiful walkway lined with colorful trees. There we came
across the Center for Brain Science, which is one of the world&rsquo; s leading Institutions for brain and
neurological research. Excited, we decided to go inside.
The first neuroscientist we met was Professor Bobby Kasthurn, a leading researcher in the Lichtman
Laboratory. A young professor with a thick beard and long, thin spectacles, he showed us a
presentation on his latest work In understanding the human brain. He said, &lsquo;Much of our work is in
understanding the working of neurons and synapses. We want to understand how the brain develops.
Neurons, the building blocks or primary cells which make up the brain and the entire nervous system,
are spread all over the body, but of course are highly concentrated in the brain itself. The presence of
neurons is unique to animals, as plants do not have them.
