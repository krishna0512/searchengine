Spoken English: Short Stories
SAND AND STONE
A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the
journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face. The one
who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand. TODAY MY BEST
FRIEND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE."They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where
they decided to take a bath. The one, who had been slapped, got stuck in the mire and
started drowning, but the friend saved him. After the friend recovered from the near
drowning, he wrote on a stone. &lsquo;TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE.The friend who
had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, &lsquo;After l hurt you, you wrote in the sand
and now, you write on a stone, why?&rsquo;
The other friend replied. &lsquo;When someone hurts us, we should write it down in sand where
winds of forgiveness can er ase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we
must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.&rdquo;
