Spoken English: Short Stories
Or so he believed, because the gardener was, in fact, one of the dwarf's assistants, and the
poison was nothing more than a potion prepared by the little investigator to cause a few
strong pains for a short while, but nothing more than that. And the footman, now found
but, was arrested by the guards and taken immediately to court.
The King, grateful, generously rewarded his wise adviser, and when he asked the dwarf
what his secret was, the dwarf smiled and said
"I only try to get the person knowing the truth to reveal that truth."
"And who knew it? If the thief had deceived everyone...
"No, your majesty, not everyone. Anyone can deceive everyone, but no one can deceive
themselves.&rdquo;
THE DRAWING THAT TALKED
Pinty Tailor was a little boy who enjoyed going to school and doing all sorts of things, except
for art and writing. Using brushes and pencils did not come easy to Pinty, so his works of art
did not end happily, and he would just give up in disgust.
But one day Pinty found a pencil of such lovely colours that he could not resist, and he tried
drawing a circle. As ever, it did not go well, and he was about to throw the pencil away
when his drawing began to speak to him.
&lsquo;Psst! You aren't going to leave me like this, are you ? Come on, the least you can do is draw
me a pair of eyes!&rsquo; said the drawing. Pinty was understandably shocked, but he managed to
draw two little spots inside the circle.
Much better, now l can see myself, said the circle, looking around at itself. &lsquo;Arghh! But
what have you done to me?!&rsquo;
I don&rsquo;t draw very well,&rsquo; said Pinty, trying to make excuses.
Ok, no problem,&rsquo; the drawing interrupted him, &lsquo;l&rsquo;m sure that if you try again you&rsquo;ll do
better. Go on, rub me out! So Pinty erased the circle and drew another one. like the first
one, it was not very round.
