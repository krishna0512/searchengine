Spoken English: Short Stories
That&rsquo;s a new car and that brick you threw is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do
it?&rdquo;
The young boy was apologetic. &lsquo;Please mister . please, I&rsquo;m sorry. l didn&rsquo;t know what else
to do,&rdquo; he pleaded. &lsquo;I threw the brick because no one else would stop.&rdquo;
With tears dripping down his face and off his chin, the youth pointed to a spot just around a

God whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes when we don&rsquo;t have time to
listen, He has to throw a brick at us.
It&rsquo;s our choice: Listen to the whisper. or wait for the brick?
