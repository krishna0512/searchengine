Spoken English: Short Stories
WORK IS WORSHIP
One fine sunny day in winter, a grasshopper was basking in the warm sun. But he was ver y
hungry, as he had not eaten anything since last night.
So, he looked about to find something to soothe his hunger. Suddenly, he saw few ants
carrying grains into their hole.
He went up to the ants and asked humbly, &lsquo;Can you, please, spare few grains for me. I
haven&rsquo;t eaten anything since yesterday. So, l am almost starving to death.&rsquo;
One of the ants asked the grasshopper, &lsquo;What were you doing the whole summer ? Why
didn&rsquo;t you store up the food for the winter season?&rdquo;
The grasshopper replied, &lsquo;Truly speaking, l spent all the summer singing songs and that&rsquo;s
why I couldn&rsquo;t store anything.&rdquo;
The ant chucked out a smile and remarked, &lsquo;Then dance the winter away.&rsquo; The grasshopper
pulled a long face and walked away.
So we say &lsquo;York is real worship&rdquo;&rdquo;!
NEVER BE UNGRATEFUL
It was high summer. The sun was extremely hot. Two travelers were going along a dusty
road that had no trees along its sides. Looking for some shelter from the hot sun, they saw a
tree with big leaves and branches spread like an umbrella.
They placed their belongings on the ground and sat in the cool thick shade of the tree. After
taking some rest, one traveler said to the other, &lsquo;What a useless tree it is! lt bears no fruits
at all.&rdquo;
Hearing this, the tree felt pinched and burst out, &lsquo;You ungrateful soul! On one hand, you are
taking shelter in my cool shade from the burning heat of the sun and on the other hand, you
are calling me useless. Get up and leave the place immediately to be scorched again.&rdquo;
