Spoken English: Short Stories
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN
Once upon a time there was a lion that grew so old that he was unable to kill any prey for
his food. So, he said to himself, &lsquo;l must do something to stay my stomach else l will die of
starvation.&rdquo;
He kept thinking and thinking and at last an idea clicked him. He decided to lie down in the
cave pretending to be ill and then who-so-ever will come to enquire about his health, will
become his prey. The old lion put his wicked plan into practice and it started working. Many
of his well-wishers got killed. But evil is short lived.
One day, a fox came to visit the ailing lion. As foxes are clever by nature, the fox stood at the
mouth of the cave and looked about. His sixth sense worked and he came to know the
reality. So, he called out to the lion from outside and said, &lsquo;How are you, sir ?&rdquo;
The lion replied, &lsquo;l am not feeling well at all. But why don&rsquo;t you come inside?&rdquo;
Then the fox replied, &lsquo;l would love to come in, sir! But on seeing, all foot prints going to your
cave and none coming out, l would be foolish enough to come in.&rsquo;
Saying so, the fox went to alert the other animals.
LIVE AND LET LIVE
Once there was a big pool near a village. The villagers used the water of the pool for
drinking and for other purposes also. The pool was abounded with fish.
Once a fisherman went fishing to the pool. He cast his net into the pool and sat down. But
he was very impatient. So, he tied a long string to a small stone. Then putting it into the
pool, he began to stir the water to drive more fish into his net.
A villager saw him do so and asked him not to make the water muddy. But the fisherman
didn&rsquo;t listen to him and went on beating the water and making it dirty. So, the villagers
brought some companions armed with weapons. Seeing them, the fisherman got scared. He
drew out his stone and apologized.&rdquo;
