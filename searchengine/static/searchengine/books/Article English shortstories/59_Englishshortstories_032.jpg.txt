Spoken English: Short Stories
The &rsquo;strike&rsquo; against the monkeys turned that place into something of a casualty ward for
baboons. There they all lay, covered in cuts and bruises, and not even a smirk crossed their
lips. Meanwhile, off went the rhino and the turtle, smiling like old friends. and while the
monkeys were putting on their sticking plasters, their chief realised it was about time they
found a better way to amuse themselves than making fun of others.
&lsquo;THE MATH DUNCE
That year, in the local school, there was a new Math teacher, as well as some new pupils
One of the new kids was the stupidest child anyone had ever seen. It made no difference
how quickly or how slowly they tried explaining numbers to him; he would always end up
saying something enormously dumb. Like two plus two was five, seven times three was
twenty-seven, or a triangle had thirty corners..
Before this boy arrived, Maths lessons had been the most boring of all. Now they were great
fun. Encouraged by the new teacher, the children would listen to the pieces of nonsense
spouted by the new kid, and they would have to correct his mistakes.
They all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then think up the most original ways
to explain them. To do this they used all kinds of stuff: sweets, playing cards, oranges, paper
planes..
It didn&rsquo;t seem like any of this bothered the new kid.
However, little Lewis was sure that it was bound to make him feel sad inside.
So, one day, he decided to follow the new kid home after school; Lewis was sure he would
see him crying.
On leaving school, the new kid walked a few minutes to a local park, and there he waited for
a while, until someone came along to meet him.
It was the new teacher 
The teacher gave the new kid a hug, and off they went, hand in hand. Following from a
distance, Lewis could hear they were talking about Math.
And that stupid new kid knew everything about it, much more than anyone in the class
